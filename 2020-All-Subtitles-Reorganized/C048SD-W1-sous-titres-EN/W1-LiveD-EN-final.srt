00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,720
-Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,560
In this video, we are going to look
at the different shortcuts Pharo provides

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,320
in order to execute,
print and inspect expressions.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,000
The first thing we are going to do
is to look at:

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,800
Pharo, Settings,

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,320
and when you are here,
you type "shortcut reminder"

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
and press Enter.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,680
And you will have to check
that this checkbox is checked,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,160
that basically,
the Shortcut Reminder is enabled.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,920
What is the Shortcut Reminder?
I will show you right now.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,840
We will open the Playground,
go to Tools,

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,160
Playground.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,120
From within this Playground,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,960
let's write a simple expression,
for example "1 + 2"

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,240
and we will try to print it,
so right click,

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
"Print it", so this is 3.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,400
But what you can see here
is that for the action "Print it",

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,800
you can use the shortcut Cmd+P.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,280
That is what we are going to do
right now.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,440
Press Cmd+P and this is...

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,120
the "Print it" command.

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,320
The shortcut reminder may show you
how to do the things you do every time

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,560
but in a quicker way
with a keyboard shortcut.

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,080
Let's look at the different commands.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,000
"Print it", we just saw it,

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
it is Cmd+P.

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
This is 3.

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,440
If we look at the "Do it" command...

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,280
This one, "Do it", nothing happens.

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,600
But we can press Cmd+D.

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,560
What happens is that it will just
compute the result

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,080
but without showing it to you.

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,320
For example,
if we use another expression,

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,520
that is "Workspace open",
this time if we do it,

35
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,440
the Workspace will open
but if we printed it,

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,240
it would both open it

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,600
and print the results
and the result is "a Workspace".

38
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,960
For the "Print it" command,

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
the shortcut is Cmd+P,

40
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,480
as you may have seen there
while I was clicking on it.

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,480
We can do Cmd+P to print
and Cmd+D to do it.

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,880
So, right here, Cmd+D.

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,920
If we look
at the two other most interesting actions

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,040
you can do on your expression,

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,560
there is "Inspect it"

46
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,120
that will open an Inspector
on the result of your expression.

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,840
Right here, 1 + 2 equals 3,

48
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,680
so we have
an "Inspector on a Smallinteger (3)"

49
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,880
from which you can explore basically

50
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,200
also the row with the variable value.

51
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,800
You can go to Integer
to have different information.

52
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,600
This is really useful if you want
to explore the result of an expression.

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,680
We can even inspect this one,
the shortcut is Cmd+I.

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,040
This is the Inspector on the Workspace,

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,640
so we have a lot of different things
going on here.

56
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Basically,
this can help you explore your results

57
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,280
and show
that what you are using is correct.

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,280
The last expression
that I think is interesting

59
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,120
is when you right-click
to the "Do it and go" or Cmd+G,

60
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,640
"Do it and go" will basically
do the same thing as Inspect

61
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,560
but put it on a side panel
like this one.

62
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,960
This is the same
Inspector on a Smallinteger,

63
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,800
but this will put it there.

64
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,720
We can do the same thing
on "Workspace open".

65
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,720
Either right-click there
or you can press Cmd+G.

66
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,520
This will do it,
so open the Workspace

67
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,320
but also open the Inspector
on the side panel.

68
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,720
These are some interesting shortcuts

69
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,320
that may help you to inspect the results

70
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,360
or simply show the result
of an expression.

71
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,040
But I think those are worth learning.

72
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,200
Remember to check the shortcut reminder

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,040
so for each task you do
with your cursor and your mouse,

74
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,280
you can have the explanation

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,840
of how you can do it quickly
at the bottom left.
