1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,560
-If we are coming back
from the last part,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,720
with the methods we defined,

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,840
the tests and everything,

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,080
now is a good time to save your image
and that is what we have done.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,160
But how to save everything locally?

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,800
We can see there
that there is a small star on our package.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,120
This means that it is not saved anywhere
except from within our image.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,360
We can just use a tool called Iceberg

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,680
that will use version control
on your package.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,080
For example, here, we can add a package,

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,560
then go to a new repository

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,760
that we will call "MyCounter".

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,120
The source directory will be "src".

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,360
Then, we can just press OK.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,560
So, MyCounter is there,
but then, if we double-click on it,

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,440
we can see that there is nothing in it
but we can add a package.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,120
So, we will add our package "MyCounter".

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,880
Okay, "MyCounter". Add.

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,680
"Uncommitted changes."

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,640
If you are familiar with Git,

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,040
it is using the exact same way
but locally.

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,360
Right now, we can do Commit.

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,800
These are all the things we added
to our package MyCounter

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,920
plus some internal files,
.project, .properties.

25
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,080
We can write a comment
for our commit, for example...

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,360
"Initial commit of a Counter

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,640
(increment
and decrement methods tested)".

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,640
And let's just commit.

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,880
Okay.

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,400
There we have a package
that has been saved.

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,200
Now, if we make some changes,

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,960
for example imagine

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,560
that we want to add another increment
called "increment2" that will add 2.

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,000
We can save this.

35
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,200
The method has been created.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,280
Now, if we want

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,640
to save these changes in our package,
you can see that,

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,800
if we go back to our "MyCounter" package
from within Iceberg,

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,320
it has some uncommitted changes.

40
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,800
So, let's just commit.

41
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,440
We can see
that "increment2" has been added

42
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,760
and we can just write "Add increment2"
and commit.

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
This is our package
that is now up-to-date.

44
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,000
This is a good way to save a version,
a history, of what you are doing

45
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,920
as well as saving your package somewhere.
