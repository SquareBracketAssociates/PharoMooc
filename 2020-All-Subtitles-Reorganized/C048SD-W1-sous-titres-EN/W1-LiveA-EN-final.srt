-Hello, everyone.
So, in this video, we are looking

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,200
at how we can highlight
and execute different expressions.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,400
Right here,
we have a three-line expression.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,480
What we are going to do is to click
and drag to highlight the first line,

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,040
then right-click and print it.

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,040
So, this is 1 000 factorial.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,960
We can also double-click
at the end of the 1st line,

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,440
this will select the whole line.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,560
Now, we can right-click
and print it again,

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,360
this is still 1 000 factorial.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,680
If we look at the two-line expression,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,720
what we can do is click and drag
to highlight the two lines,

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,760
right-click and print it.

16
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,800
This is 1 000 factorial
divided by 999 factorial.

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,720
This is 1 000, which is correct.

18
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,840
And for the three-line expression,

19
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,960
we can put the cursor at the end

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,080
and simply double-click,
this will select the whole expression.

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,000
From now on,
we can right-click and print.

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,080
These are some quick tips to select
and execute your expressions

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,800
and you can basically do this

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,840
in every Playground
or any Pharo environment.
