1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:00,640
"ProfStef"

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,000
Quentin Ducasse.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,800
-Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,320
In this lesson, we are going to look
at the tool named ProfStef.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,200
Basically, to launch it,

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,400
all you have to do is to write
"ProfStef go" in a Playground

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,120
and just highlight it

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,280
and do it.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,160
This opens the tool.
There is some presentation.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,600
Basically, this tool is there
to help you learn Pharo by yourself.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,760
What you can do is,
for each lesson,

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,320
you can see here
that there are 29 lessons,

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,400
you will have some explanation,

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,120
then a "ProfStef next"
to access the next lesson.

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,360
What we can do is highlight it,
right click it and do it

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,840
to go to the next lesson.

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,320
So, once again,
you have some explanations.

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,200
These are explanations
on the "Do it" command.

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,760
What we can do, for example,

20
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,520
is select the "GTPlayground open",
right-click and do it.

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,760
This opens a Playground.

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,040
What we can do next
is do it to the next lesson

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,560
with "ProfStef next".

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,320
Do it.

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,920
This is an explanation
of the "Print it" command.

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,280
You can highlight, right-click
and print it this time

27
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,280
so it shows a 3.

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,600
We can do the same thing
with other expressions.

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,840
I will let you try those by yourself.

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,920
Let's go to the next lesson, do it.

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,040
And these are some explanations
of the "Inspect it" command, so this one.

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,600
Basically, if we highlight the "1/2",

33
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,520
it opens the Inspector on a fraction,
so half.

34
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,120
Basically, the flow of this tool
is to have some explanation.

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,360
Try it yourself

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,680
and then, inspect and browse
all the different commands Pharo offers.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,880
I would really encourage you
to look at this tool

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
and try commands,

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,040
maybe do the 29 lessons
if you are motivated.
