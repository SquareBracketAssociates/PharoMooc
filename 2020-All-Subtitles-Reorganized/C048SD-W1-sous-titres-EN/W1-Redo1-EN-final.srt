"Redo: Package,
Classes and Methods"

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:01,680
Quentin Ducasse.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,760
-Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,600
In this first redo,

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,240
we are going to look
at how to create a package,

6
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,520
how to create a class within the package,

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,280
and how to define some methods

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,080
and see if everything
is working correctly.

9
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,160
First, you can open the Pharo menu.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,760
Then you go to the Tools,

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
and System Browser.

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,400
There, you can see all the packages

13
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,320
that are loaded
within your image,

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,680
so there are quite a lot.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,280
Since we want to create a new one,
we can right-click on any of them

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,120
and just go to New package,

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,280
say "MyCounter", press "OK".

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,640
Our package has been created there

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,280
but since we do not really want
to see all the other ones,

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,160
we can just filter them out
to "MyCounter".

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,800
There, our package is there,
it is quite empty

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,920
and we have a template
to create a class

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,600
so it will be a subclass
of the class "Object"

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,240
and we can name it there.

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,320
Let's name it "Counter"

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,680
and we can attribute
an instance variable to it

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
so let's go with "count".

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,360
Then, we can see
that there is this orange triangle

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,760
in the top right corner.

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,680
This means that your method
has not been compiled

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
and in order to do so,
you can right-click and go to "Accept"

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,360
or press the shortcut Cmd+S.

33
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,920
Let's just accept.

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,040
There it is,
our class has been created

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,680
but there is a red exclamation mark
on the right side.

36
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,160
This means that there is no comment.

37
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,200
As you can see there,
there is a comment,

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,440
but it is simply recommendations
on how to comment your class.

39
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,800
You are encouraged to do it
but we are not going to do it right now.

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,640
We are just going to do
the right method,

41
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,440
so let's just go this tab right here.

42
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,280
Let's double-click

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,920
and write some accessors
to our instance variable.

44
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,200
So, let's go to "count".

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,160
This will be the getter.

46
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,560
Let's just write
the "count" instance variable.

47
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,800
The orange triangle is there,
so press Cmd+S.

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,600
Our method is there.

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,680
Now, if we want to make the setter,

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,600
let's just count and pass it an integer.

51
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,800
And the "count" variable should now

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,920
get the value of this integer

53
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,320
so we can just write this like that.

54
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,480
Compile it again, Cmd+S.

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,840
We have our two accessors.

56
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,640
They have been put

57
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,400
into the "accessing" protocol
automatically

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,040
and this is correct.

59
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,840
Now, let's see if we can make
all those work.

60
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,160
Let's go to another tool
called the Playground.

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,400
Let's just go to the Pharo menu,
to Tools,

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,320
then Playground.

63
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,280
And from there, we can create
a temporary variable that we call c.

64
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,160
We can make it a counter

65
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,800
so "c = Counter new".

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,160
And now, we want
the count instance variable to be 7.

67
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,080
And in order to see if this chain
has common effects,

68
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,800
we can just call the getter "c count".

69
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,600
In order to see everything,

70
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,480
we can double-click at the end
so it selects everything

71
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,880
and then press Cmd+P
or just right-click and go to "Print it".

72
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,720
We can see that this is 7,

73
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,360
this is the value we attributed to
the instance variable so it is correct.

74
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,720
In this video,

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,800
we saw how to create a package,
a class,

76
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,440
some accessor methods

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,560
and how we can visualize it
in the Playground,

78
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,760
but this behavior right here,

79
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,040
we might want to put this into test

80
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,640
and we will see that
in the next part of the redo.
