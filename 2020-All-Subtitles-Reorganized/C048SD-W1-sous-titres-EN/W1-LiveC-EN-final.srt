00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:03,840
-Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,960
In this video, we are going
to look at syntax highlighting

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,240
and how it can help you
have direct feedback from the system

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,760
on the code you are writing.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,280
For example,
if we begin by writing a capitalized C,

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,720
we can see that it is in italics.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,280
That means that this prefix
is recognized by the system

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,560
to be the beginning
of an existing class name.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,320
If we write "Color",

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,520
we can see that this word
is no longer in italics,

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,520
it has been recognized by the system

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,240
as being an existing class.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,200
But what happens if we write "Colox".

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,400
This is red and this means
that it is not recognized by the system,

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,440
either because you have not installed
the correct package

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,680
or simply because it is the wrong syntax.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,520
Right here, it is the wrong syntax.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,320
If we go back to "Color",

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,560
and then we begin writing
a method name,

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,120
for example "ne".

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,760
This is in italics,

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,040
so that means the same thing
as for the class name,

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,960
that this beginning is recognized
by the system

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,320
but now if we write for example "nexx".

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,880
This is red,
this is not recognized by the system,

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,440
but if instead, we write "new",

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,760
this name is no longer italicized

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,520
so that means this method
is recognized by the system

29
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,680
according to this class.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,600
"Color new" is something

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,920
that will potentially work
or at least is recognized by the system.

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,400
These were some quick tips

33
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,520
on how to get instant feedback
on the code you are writing

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,360
in a syntaxic way.

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,120
This will not ensure
that your code is always working,

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,520
but it means it is still recognized
by the system.
