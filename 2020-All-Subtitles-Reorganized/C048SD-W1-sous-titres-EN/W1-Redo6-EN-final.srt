00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,160
"Redo: Better printing with printOn:"

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:01,920
Quentin Ducasse.

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,880
-Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,320
In part 6 of the redo,

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,840
we will see how to change the output
the "Print it" command gave us.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,400
For now, we will look
at the Counter object we created,

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,000
if we remove the "increment"
and print everything.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,880
So, double-click, right-click, Print it
or we can simply press Cmd+P.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,280
We can see that it is a counter

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,440
but we do not have much info
on the value it holds

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,000
and this might be valuable.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,880
In order to change that,

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,800
we have to take a look
at the printOn method.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,160
Let's go there and write the "printOn:"

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,280
so it takes "aStream" as an argument
and...

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,360
We want to keep the Counter
we had before.

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,520
So, this is a Counter.

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,200
But we want to add value.

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,480
We have to do : "aStream nextPutAll:".

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,040
And we have to add "withValue"

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,440
and in order to concatenate two strings,
we will use the comma

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,280
and then write "count"

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,800
and convert for count
to a string with "printString".

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,920
This is a counter,

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,880
this is "withValue",

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,440
and this will add the actual value
of "count" to a string.

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,520
And now,

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,000
we will add a carriage return.

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,400
Let's save all this

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,960
and see how it works now.

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,360
We should have a Counter
with value 0, right?

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,840
Let's print it.

33
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,320
"Counter withValue 0". That is great.

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,160
Now, if we change this,
and make it start at 23,

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,880
and print this,

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,920
"Counter withValue 23".
So, that is cool.

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,640
That is working as expected and it is
a good time to commit what we changed.

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,120
Let's go to Commit,

39
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,160
say: "printOn method corrected

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,480
(with value)".

41
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,040
And let's commit everything.

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,280
So, in this part,

43
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,000
we learned how to change the output
we can get with a "Print it" command

44
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
on an object we have defined.
