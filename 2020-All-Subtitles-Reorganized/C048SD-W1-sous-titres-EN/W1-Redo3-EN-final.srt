00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,840
-Hello, so we are in part 3 of the redo

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,880
and this is more to precise

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,640
something that might have caught
your attention in the last part

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,560
which is method creation.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,120
So, I often just...

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,960
overwrite the code and the text
of a previous method.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,080
For example, here,
if I want to create a decrement 2,

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,280
I will simply go to Decrement
and rename it to "decrement2 count -2".

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,640
You can see that we are modifying
the code of "decrement".

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,160
You can see there that we are
in the tab Decrement with a small star,

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,280
meaning that we have not saved yet.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,400
It should overwrite
the decrement method, right?

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,000
No, because when we save,

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,080
it will look at the name of the method
we just created

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,840
and if it changed
from the initial place we were in.

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,400
For example, here,
we are in Decrement

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,360
but the method we created
is "decrement2"

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,280
so it created a new method.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
Same thing if we go there
and write "increment12",

20
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,120
that will add 12,

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,160
we are modifying the increment method.

22
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,600
There is this little star.

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,720
But as soon as we compile and save,
pressing Cmd+S,

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,680
this will create a new method
because the name has changed.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,800
However, if we go to the increment,

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,680
now we want our basic increment method
to increment by 2,

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,240
which we do by simply changing
the "+1" to "+2",

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,080
and if we save,
the name is the same.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,680
So, no new method has been added

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
but the increment method has changed.

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,120
Another thing is that there are no ways
to add a method from the menu

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,080
but there is a way to remove the methods.

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,120
We can just remove "decrement2" there.

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,280
This was just a clarification
on how to create and remove methods,

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,400
which might have troubled you.
