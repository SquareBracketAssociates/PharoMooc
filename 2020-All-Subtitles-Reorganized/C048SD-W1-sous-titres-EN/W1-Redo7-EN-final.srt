00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,960
-Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,720
In this part 7 of the redo
and the last part,

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,280
we will look at the history

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,960
that the tool Iceberg will use
to save our changes

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,640
and commit them somewhere.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,600
We will generate
the history of these changes

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,080
so let's go into the Iceberg tool.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,120
We can go to our repository MyCounter,

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,360
right-click and go to Repository.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,160
There we have a history
of the commits we did.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,640
For example, the initial commit,

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,680
the time I added "increment2"

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,720
to show you the Iceberg way
to commit things,

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,480
then the initialization methods
and then printOn.

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,600
So, we can also see a difference
between these commits and HEAD,

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,600
which is the commit we are writing
right now in this image.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,160
For example, here,

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,680
since the first commit,
we added "increment2",

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,720
"initialize",

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,160
started at the "printOn" method
and some test methods.

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,120
We can look at the difference
between these commits

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,800
and the commit before it.

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,920
Between "added 'increment2'"
and "initialization methods",

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,040
we can see that we added
the initialization methods.

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,000
We can have a good insight
of how our project development went.

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,000
And another interesting thing is that,

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,880
imagine that we do not need
the "printOn" or initialization methods

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,480
or they were wrong,

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,720
we can just go back
to this commit right here

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,120
by right-clicking and using Checkout.

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,920
This will show us the changes
that happened to the image.

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,640
This will remove "printOn"

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,520
and the initialization methods
and tests we made.

34
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,560
Press "Checkout" and if we look
at the System Browser here,

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
we can see that the "printOn"
and initialization methods

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,320
have just disappeared.

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,120
It is a good way for you
to come back to your code

38
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,840
if you made a choice that was not right

39
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,520
or if you feel
like there is another solution.

40
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,000
Iceberg can handle that for you.

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,680
So, this video was about
how to use Iceberg

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,400
to get a more insightful look
in your own project development

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,720
and how you might do things differently
by going back to a previous commit.
