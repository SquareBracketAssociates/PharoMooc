1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,090
I’d like to show you the
Pharo Launcher.

2
00:00:04,257 --> 00:00:06,030
Pharo Launcher is a tool
developped

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,590
independently from Pharo and
which, in the end, will replace

4
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:14,460
Pharo App that we have seen in the
other session about understanding exchange.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,630
This is an application that
enables to manage

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,730
a whole set of images, and
above all to access to all

7
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:26,790
the integration servers which
will enable you, each

8
00:00:26,957 --> 00:00:28,250
time you commit, to recreate
an

9
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:30,920
image and to download it
very easily.

10
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:33,880
I typed PharoLauncher
in Google to show you.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,450
If you go on Inria Jenkins,
what do you get?

12
00:00:38,617 --> 00:00:41,140
You get this page.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,630
There is an official website.

14
00:00:42,797 --> 00:00:45,040
Ok, the official website is
on SmallTalk Hub.

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,680
And here if I want to install
on Mac OS X

16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,250
I will

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,070
download a .dmg.

18
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,370
If I unzip the .dmg,
I get an application named

19
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:14,520
Pharo and that should be named
Pharo Launcher, it would be better.

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,430
Something is nice in this application,
and I personnaly use it

21
00:01:18,597 --> 00:01:23,580
all the time,

22
00:01:23,747 --> 00:01:25,390
it shows you (normally when you
will launch it

23
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:26,190
you won’t see anything)…

24
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:29,230
For me here, it shows all the things
I have installed on my system.

25
00:01:29,397 --> 00:01:32,900
What is very nice, it is that on
the left, this

26
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:35,640
list, these are the images
on which I am

27
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:40,500
working, and on the right,
these are

28
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:45,420
shortcuts, for example you
can get the

29
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:48,250
Pharo version 5 Beta,
the stable version 4.

30
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,270
So this one, these are my favorites ones.

31
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,240
Next, you can access to all
images you

32
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:59,060
have downloaded recently
and that are stored

33
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:01,950
locally, in order for you
not to need to

34
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:04,400
download from the server,
because it can be

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,960
troublesome depending on your
internet connexion.

36
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:11,340
Mine being slow,
it is troublesome.

37
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:12,460
So, you have that sort of things.

38
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:13,920
Now, what is great, it is
that you have

39
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:16,750
access to Pharo Contribution Jenkins.

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,233
What is it?

41
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,520
It is a Jenkins server
on which people can

42
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,060
store a certain number of projects,
you just have to

43
00:02:26,227 --> 00:02:27,570
ask to get an access.

44
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,290
There are many things, I don’t
know precisely what they are.

45
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,150
You can choose

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,490
different versions.

47
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,580
I am going to show you Seaside,
the dynamic web

48
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:48,130
application server,

49
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:49,710
I have, for example, all the build.

50
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,800
For one build, I get the message
“do you want a Pharo 2.0,

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,300
a Pharo 3.0,

52
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,100
a Pharo 4.0 version,

53
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:58,890
in BleedInEdge, under development,
under release, under release

54
00:02:59,057 --> 00:02:59,690
1.3.

55
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:02,520
I won’t get it because I have
it already

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
but what is great,
so I have it here,

57
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:11,000
if I tell it to create an image,

58
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:16,000
I call it Seaside, here
it extracts

59
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:19,810
the image from my cache and
it goes here, and now I can execute it.

60
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,210
And here, I have my Seaside image.

61
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,750
What is great, if you look
a little bit at Seaside,

62
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,670
Seaside is quite big,
there are all these

63
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:30,790
packages in the system
with I don’t know how many

64
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:36,600
classes

65
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:37,400
to download.

66
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,110
So, it is very practical because
what is great, I will take

67
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:41,580
another example…

68
00:03:41,747 --> 00:03:46,120
if I exit, now I am working on…

69
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,260
I have Smalltalk mathematic
library, called

70
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:54,750
Sci-Smalltalk, I have my environment.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,420
Each time I commit code from this

72
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:03,510
this image, on the
repository of Sci-Smalltalk,

73
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,870
there will be a Jenkins job
that will see it and

74
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,300
rebuild the image, and
propose me to download it

75
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,120
after having run tests.

76
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,380
So here, if I go in contribution
and I look for

77
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:23,140
Sci-Smalltalk,

78
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:25,790
this is the same, I have all the builds
with the different Pharo versions.

79
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:27,110
Here, there are fewer.
There are 4.0

80
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:28,460
under stable development,

81
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,310
5.0 under unstable development.

82
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:34,020
If I want to get one,
I will download it.

83
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,550
I do “Create image”

84
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,910
And automatically, I can
get the last

85
00:04:40,077 --> 00:04:42,330
configuration loaded,
according to

86
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:46,400
configurations and to
how I have configured my Jenkins job.

87
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,640
Pharo Launcher, I strongly encourage you
to use it

88
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:51,440
because it is really great.

89
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,530
In conclusion, Pharo Launcher
is really very nice

90
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:59,540
because it combines at the same time
the access to your jobs and

91
00:04:59,707 --> 00:05:01,420
the organisation on your system files.

92
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,230
When you work on several projects,

93
00:05:03,397 --> 00:05:06,290
it is always nice to have an
overview on your projects.

94
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,920
Pharo Launcher has been developped
by Damien Cassou,

95
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,900
who is one of the three authors
of this MOOC, and I really

96
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:14,210
thank him for this, it is really cool.
