WEBVTT

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.090 align:middle
I’d like to show you the
Pharo Launcher.

00:00:04.257 --> 00:00:06.030 align:middle
Pharo Launcher is a tool
developped

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.590 align:middle
independently from Pharo and
which, in the end, will replace

00:00:09.757 --> 00:00:14.460 align:middle
Pharo App that we have seen in the
other session about understanding exchange.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.630 align:middle
This is an application that
enables to manage

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.730 align:middle
a whole set of images, and
above all to access to all

00:00:23.897 --> 00:00:26.790 align:middle
the integration servers which
will enable you, each

00:00:26.957 --> 00:00:28.250 align:middle
time you commit, to recreate
an

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle
image and to download it
very easily.

00:00:31.087 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle
I typed PharoLauncher
in Google to show you.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle
If you go on Inria Jenkins,
what do you get?

00:00:38.617 --> 00:00:41.140 align:middle
You get this page.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle
There is an official website.

00:00:42.797 --> 00:00:45.040 align:middle
Ok, the official website is
on SmallTalk Hub.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle
And here if I want to install
on Max OS X

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.250 align:middle
I will

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.070 align:middle
download a .dmg.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle
If I unzip the .dmg,
I get an application named

00:01:12.537 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle
Pharo and that should be named
Pharo Launcher, it would be better.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.430 align:middle
Something is nice in this application,
and I personnaly use it

00:01:18.597 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle
all the time,

00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle
it shows you (normally when you
will launch it

00:01:25.557 --> 00:01:26.190 align:middle
you won’t see anything)…

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:29.230 align:middle
For me here, it shows all the things
I have installed on my system.

00:01:29.397 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle
What is very nice, it is that on
the left, this

00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:35.640 align:middle
list, these are the images
on which I am

00:01:35.807 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle
working, and on the right,
these are

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle
shortcuts, for example you
can get the

00:01:45.587 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle
Pharo version 5 Beta,
the stable version 4.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.270 align:middle
So this one, these are my favorites ones.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.240 align:middle
Next, you can access to all
images you

00:01:55.407 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle
have downloaded recently
and that are stored

00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle
locally, in order for you
not to need to

00:02:02.117 --> 00:02:04.400 align:middle
download from the server,
because it can be

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle
troublesome depending on your
internet connexion.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:11.340 align:middle
Mine being slow,
it is troublesome.

00:02:11.507 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle
So, you have that sort of things.

00:02:12.627 --> 00:02:13.920 align:middle
Now, what is great, it is
that you have

00:02:14.087 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle
access to Pharo Contribution Jenkins.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.233 align:middle
What is it?

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle
It is a Jenkins server
on which people can

00:02:24.687 --> 00:02:26.060 align:middle
store a certain number of projects,
you just have to

00:02:26.227 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle
ask to get an access.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle
There are many things, I don’t
know precisely what they are.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle
You can choose

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle
different versions.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle
I am going to show you Seaside,
the dynamic web

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle
application server,

00:02:48.297 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle
I have, for example, all the build.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.800 align:middle
For one build, I get the message
“do you want a Pharo 2.0,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle
a Pharo 3.0,

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:56.100 align:middle
a Pharo 4.0 version,

00:02:56.267 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle
in BleedInEdge, under development,
under release, under release

00:02:59.057 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle
1.3.

00:02:59.857 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle
I won’t get it because I have
it already

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle
but what is great,
so I have it here,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle
if I tell it to create an image,

00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle
I call it Seaside, here
it extracts

00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle
the image from my cache and
it goes here, and now I can execute it.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle
And here, I have my Seaside image.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle
What is great, if you look
a little bit at Seaside,

00:03:23.917 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle
Seaside is quite big,
there are all these

00:03:26.837 --> 00:03:30.790 align:middle
packages in the system
with I don’t know how many

00:03:30.957 --> 00:03:36.600 align:middle
classes

00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle
to download.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.110 align:middle
So, it is very practical because
what is great, I will take

00:03:40.277 --> 00:03:41.580 align:middle
another example…

00:03:41.747 --> 00:03:46.120 align:middle
if I exit, now I am working on…

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.260 align:middle
I have Smalltalk mathematic
library, called

00:03:51.427 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle
Sci-Smalltalk, I have my environment.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.420 align:middle
Each time I commit code from this

00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle
this image, on the
repository of Sci-Smalltalk,

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle
there will be a Jenkins job
that will see it and

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle
rebuild the image, and
propose me to download it

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle
after having run tests.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle
So here, if I go in contribution
and I look for

00:04:16.547 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle
Sci-Smalltalk,

00:04:23.307 --> 00:04:25.790 align:middle
this is the same, I have all the builds
with the different Pharo versions.

00:04:25.957 --> 00:04:27.110 align:middle
Here, there are fewer.
There are 4.0

00:04:27.277 --> 00:04:28.460 align:middle
under stable development,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle
5.0 under unstable development.

00:04:30.477 --> 00:04:34.020 align:middle
If I want to get one,
I will download it.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle
I do “Create image”

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.910 align:middle
And automatically, I can
get the last

00:04:40.077 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle
configuration loaded,
according to

00:04:42.497 --> 00:04:46.400 align:middle
configurations and to
how I have configured my Jenkins job.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle
Pharo Launcher, I strongly encourage you
to use it

00:04:50.807 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle
because it is really great.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.530 align:middle
In conclusion, Pharo Launcher
is really very nice

00:04:54.697 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle
because it combines at the same time
the access to your jobs and

00:04:59.707 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle
the organisation on your system files.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle
When you work on several projects,

00:05:03.397 --> 00:05:06.290 align:middle
it is always nice to have an
overview on your projects.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle
Pharo Launcher has been developped
by Damien Cassou,

00:05:10.087 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle
who is one of the three authors
of this MOOC, and I really

00:05:13.067 --> 00:05:14.210 align:middle
thank him for this, it is really cool.
