00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.920 align:middle
In this video, I’d like
to show you that we can

00:00:03.087 --> 00:00:05.590 align:middle
browse, compute the differences
between the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.000 align:middle
committed package versions
on a repository.

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:12.730 align:middle
Here, I’m gonna use a local
repository.

00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:15.170 align:middle
So this means that if you don’t
use Small Talk hub and

00:00:15.337 --> 00:00:16.760 align:middle
and you work with a team,
you can compute

00:00:16.927 --> 00:00:21.240 align:middle
the differences and merges of codes that
you can share with others.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.620 align:middle
I use Monticello,
this is why I have in fact

00:00:26.787 --> 00:00:30.190 align:middle
versioned many versions
of this package.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.800 align:middle
I open, I click on Open.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle
Here, I see all the versions

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.633 align:middle
of my package.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.190 align:middle
Now if I consider the last
version,

00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:44.120 align:middle
I can browse, it means I
want to see

00:00:44.287 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle
what is inside the package
which is on the repository.

00:00:46.427 --> 00:00:49.050 align:middle
If I do “Browse”, you see that
I have the very last

00:00:49.217 --> 00:00:53.000 align:middle
package version.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.060 align:middle
And it shows the extensions:
“You are extending this.”

00:00:55.227 --> 00:00:55.860 align:middle

00:00:56.027 --> 00:00:57.430 align:middle
Now if I consider an older
version, like

00:00:57.597 --> 00:01:00.640 align:middle
this one, and I browse,
we will see that I only

00:01:00.807 --> 00:01:04.060 align:middle
have 2 classes left and
I haven’t any extensions.

00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle
You already see, I can
look at what

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.930 align:middle
is published on a server and
go and see the content inside.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle
Now in my image,
I have the latest version so

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle
I can compare the changes.

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:19.270 align:middle
It means that I can see
“Give me the changes

00:01:19.437 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle
between this image and what is
loaded in the system.”

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle
The system warns us:
“Careful, if you

00:01:27.407 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle
load this package, it will
suppress all these methods”,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle
and obviously I want to see
the methods.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle
Now I can,
when using the “history button”,

00:01:35.517 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle
for example if I want to
know what

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.670 align:middle
has happened between version 7
and version 4.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.330 align:middle
I choose version 7, I click on
History, it

00:01:46.497 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle
shows me several versions.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle
I go from version 4, so I
select

00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:53.520 align:middle
version 4 and I say
“I want to see

00:01:53.687 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle
the changes
to version 7.”

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle
And here, it shows
“Here is what you have done.”

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle
So obviously, here I have only
added things

00:02:01.327 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle
but if I had modified, for
example, if I had modified

00:02:04.077 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle
a method category and protocol,
it would show

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle
me all the changes.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.170 align:middle
In the same way, if I want to see
what happened

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.890 align:middle
between version 11 and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle
version 8 for instance…

00:02:22.527 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle
here I added + and
that kind of thing.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle
You can see that in Pharo you
have all the tools

00:02:26.937 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle
allowing you to manage a project
with several members.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle
Further more, you will have
all the access rights managed

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle
by the different systems,
such as SmalltalkHub or

00:02:36.717 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle
SqueakSource, and you can
work in group very easily

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:42.820 align:middle
and in team on Pharo.
By the way, this is how

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle
Pharo itself is being developped.
