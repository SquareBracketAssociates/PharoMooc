In this video, I'd
like to show you how

00:00:03.727 --> 00:00:05.900 align:middle
Nautilus enables to browse
inside

00:00:06.067 --> 00:00:08.590 align:middle
classes, and how to make more
detailed analyses.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.210 align:middle
Let's open Nautilus.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.560 align:middle
We select once more Parser class.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.660 align:middle
Now if I go there, I have
an item menu

00:00:18.827 --> 00:00:21.300 align:middle
called Analyze.
Analyze offers me

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.720 align:middle
several queries on the system.
Here for example it will

00:00:23.887 --> 00:00:27.730 align:middle
let me know all the methods

00:00:27.897 --> 00:00:29.790 align:middle
referring to an instance variable,
all the methods

00:00:29.957 --> 00:00:32.210 align:middle
making assignments to instance
variables,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle
all the unreferenced 
instance variables, 

00:00:35.257 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle
all the unreferenced
class variables.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.950 align:middle
Previously, we've seen there
were class references.

00:00:41.117 --> 00:00:44.750 align:middle
But let's have a look: if I 
select instance variables, base,

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle
I get all the NumberParser class 
methods

00:00:48.267 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle
accessing to base
in a way or another.

00:00:52.597 --> 00:00:55.400 align:middle
Here by assigning it, and there
by using it.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle
It is so useful that 

00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:03.360 align:middle
this button does it.
If I do the same with base,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle
I can get the accesses to my

00:01:08.647 --> 00:01:09.400 align:middle
instance variables.
