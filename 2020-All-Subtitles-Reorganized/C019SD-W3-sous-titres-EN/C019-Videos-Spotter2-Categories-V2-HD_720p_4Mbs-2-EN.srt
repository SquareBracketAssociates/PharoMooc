In this video,
I’d like to show you that Spotter

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,240
offers categories to sort
your search results,

3
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,600
and how you can select them.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,320
Let’s imagine I search for a package
containing the Spotter word.

5
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:17,340
Here, Spotter shows me I can
access to Spotter 

6
00:00:17,507 --> 00:00:20,090
via a menu, I can browse all
the classes

7
00:00:20,257 --> 00:00:22,360
containing Spotter,
here it shows me I get

8
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:24,270
5/122, and there, #Package.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,520
You see that each time
there is the

10
00:00:27,687 --> 00:00:31,280
word #Menu, #Class,
#Package, #Implementer,

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,760
it’s what we call categories
in Spotter.

12
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:38,380
Now, if I want to select a
category in particular,

13
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:41,390
I start by typing the beginning

14
00:00:41,557 --> 00:00:43,370
of the category, so P A.
There is only one beginning

15
00:00:43,537 --> 00:00:48,170
with #pa, so #Package. And there,
it shows Spotter packages.

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,600
If I consider GT-Spotter and I
type enter, I go

17
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:53,880
on the Spotter package.
