00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.460 align:middle
I’d like to show you 
how to browse very fast

00:00:04.627 --> 00:00:06.150 align:middle
the code of a class
with Spotter.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.830 align:middle
To get Spotter type
shift enter, and enter

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.330 align:middle
the Point class name, here I 
can choose, and

00:00:13.497 --> 00:00:15.750 align:middle
if it’s Point, I type Enter
and I open

00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:17.120 align:middle
directly the class browser.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.250 align:middle
Now I type again Point,
Spotter shows me the

00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:25.220 align:middle
history, but also the other
classes,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.080 align:middle
as PointArray or PointTest, 
for instance.

00:00:29.247 --> 00:00:31.340 align:middle
If I want to go on PointTest,
here, I am on PointTest.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.910 align:middle
Now, I type again the history,
automatically I

00:00:37.077 --> 00:00:39.370 align:middle
am on the last class browsed,

00:00:39.537 --> 00:00:40.610 align:middle
so I can do it really fast.
