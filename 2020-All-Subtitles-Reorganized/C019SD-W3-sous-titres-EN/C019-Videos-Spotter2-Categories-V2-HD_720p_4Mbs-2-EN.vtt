In this video,
I’d like to show you that Spotter

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.240 align:middle
offers categories to sort
your search results,

00:00:06.407 --> 00:00:08.600 align:middle
and how you can select them.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.320 align:middle
Let’s imagine I search for a package
containing the Spotter word.

00:00:13.487 --> 00:00:17.340 align:middle
Here, Spotter shows me I can
access to Spotter 

00:00:17.507 --> 00:00:20.090 align:middle
via a menu, I can browse all
the classes

00:00:20.257 --> 00:00:22.360 align:middle
containing Spotter,
here it shows me I get

00:00:22.527 --> 00:00:24.270 align:middle
5/122, and there, #Package.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle
You see that each time
there is the

00:00:27.687 --> 00:00:31.280 align:middle
word #Menu, #Class,
#Package, #Implementer,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle
it’s what we call categories
in Spotter.

00:00:35.927 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle
Now, if I want to select a
category in particular,

00:00:38.547 --> 00:00:41.390 align:middle
I start by typing the beginning

00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:43.370 align:middle
of the category, so P A.
There is only one beginning

00:00:43.537 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle
with #pa, so #Package. And there,
it shows Spotter packages.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle
If I consider GT-Spotter and I
type enter, I go

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle
on the Spotter package.
