00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,560
In this video, I'd
like to show you how

2
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:05,900
Nautilus enables to browse
inside

3
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:08,590
classes, and how to make more
detailed analyses.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,210
Let's open Nautilus.

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,560
We select once more Parser class.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,660
Now if I go there, I have
an item menu

7
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:21,300
called Analyze.
Analyze offers me

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,720
several queries on the system.
Here for example it will

9
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:27,730
let me know all the methods

10
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:29,790
referring to an instance variable,
all the methods

11
00:00:29,957 --> 00:00:32,210
making assignments to instance
variables,

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,090
all the unreferenced 
instance variables, 

13
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:37,810
all the unreferenced
class variables.

14
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,950
Previously, we've seen there
were class references.

15
00:00:41,117 --> 00:00:44,750
But let's have a look: if I 
select instance variables, base,

16
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:48,100
I get all the NumberParser class 
methods

17
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:52,430
accessing to base
in a way or another.

18
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:55,400
Here by assigning it, and there
by using it.

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,610
It is so useful that 

20
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:03,360
this button does it.
If I do the same with base,

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,480
I can get the accesses to my

22
00:01:08,647 --> 00:01:09,400
instance variables.
