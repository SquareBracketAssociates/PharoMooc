00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,310
In this session, 
I’d like to complete the one

2
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:08,230
about the debugger and
show you how to detect a bug.

3
00:00:08,397 --> 00:00:12,440
Let’s imagine we change
the decrement definition

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,350
and we make a mistake.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,950
Here, I put an addition instead
of a substraction.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,000
When I run my tests, the
TestDecrement returns false.

7
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:26,440
I execute it, I look at the 
execution and I notice

8
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:30,550
that indeed count returns
9 instead of 5.

9
00:00:30,717 --> 00:00:33,540
So it shows that I do have 
an error among these

10
00:00:33,707 --> 00:00:36,120
expressions, if I consider that
the counter has been created.

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,520
Here I’d like to execute

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,930
the code and stop just after

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,200
the Counter creation to see
which methods

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,840
have a problem.

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,400
i add Self halt, this is one of
the ways to propose a

16
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:55,040
break point in Pharo. I compile
again the method, I do

17
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:59,630
Proceed, the code is executed
and stops on the halt method.

18
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,710
So now I click on “Over”.

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,850
I can decide to go inside

20
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:07,110
the count method, that’s
what I do for example,

21
00:01:07,277 --> 00:01:09,790
I can see that count value is
nil and Integer value is 7

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,910
like here, and there I can click
on “Over”.

23
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,580
I go back, I have decrement.

24
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:25,730
I’m going to look inside it

25
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:27,540
because the problem must be there,
and here

26
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:29,680
I can see that decrement is 
equal to -1.

27
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,680
I modify it, “Over”.

28
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,000
And now I can click on “Proceed”.

29
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,530
When I click on “Proceed” the debug
is left, I remove it,

30
00:01:47,697 --> 00:01:51,490
I click on “Proceed” and my test is green.
