1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,000
I’d like to show you 
that with Spotter, you can

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:06,280
also restrict the search area.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,420
That’s what we will see.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,580
I call Spotter. Let’s imagine
I search for the examples,

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,870
I write “example”, and 
I know that

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,730
I’m looking for the examples
defined with

7
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:23,430
a pragma or which methods 
are tagged with a pragma.

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,330
Here, I see that there are 4
pragmas containing the word

9
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:29,440
"example": there is
"example", "exampleWidget",

10
00:00:29,607 --> 00:00:32,830
"worldMenuExample" and
"gtExample". Here to be

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,070
more precise, I can see
"example", so all those 

12
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:40,600
methods contain an “example”
tag, and I see "gtExample".

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,443
Let’s choose "gtExample".

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,020
Now I am going to 

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,160
select all the methods containing
"gtExample".

16
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:54,830
Here, I see that there are pragmas
and methods with

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,900
"gtExample" in their name, 
and that the ones I’m interested in.

18
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,130
So I’m gonna select them.

19
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:00,670
Now I have all these methods.

20
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,080
I can choose to say “No,
I only want to see those

21
00:01:06,247 --> 00:01:10,560
which are in
Morph". And then I see all the
22
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:14,260
methods containing either 
the Morph class, or the

23
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:19,150
morph method, and I can
see the code associated with

24
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:20,890
each method.
