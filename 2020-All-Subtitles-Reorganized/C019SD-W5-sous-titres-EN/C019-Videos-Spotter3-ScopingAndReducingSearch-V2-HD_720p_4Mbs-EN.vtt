I’d like to show you 
that with Spotter, you can

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:06.280 align:middle
also restrict the search area.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.420 align:middle
That’s what we will see.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.580 align:middle
I call Spotter. Let’s imagine
I search for the examples,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.870 align:middle
I write “example”, and 
I know that

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.730 align:middle
I’m looking for the examples
defined with

00:00:20.897 --> 00:00:23.430 align:middle
a pragma or which methods 
are tagged with a pragma.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle
Here, I see that there are 4
pragmas containing the word

00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:29.440 align:middle
"example": there is
"example", "exampleWidget",

00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:32.830 align:middle
"worldMenuExample" and
"gtExample". Here to be

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.070 align:middle
more precise, I can see
"example", so all those 

00:00:36.237 --> 00:00:40.600 align:middle
methods contain an “example”
tag, and I see "gtExample".

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.443 align:middle
Let’s choose "gtExample".

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle
Now I am going to 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle
select all the methods containing
"gtExample".

00:00:50.327 --> 00:00:54.830 align:middle
Here, I see that there are pragmas
and methods with

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle
"gtExample" in their name, 
and that the ones I’m interested in.

00:00:57.067 --> 00:00:59.130 align:middle
So I’m gonna select them.

00:00:59.297 --> 00:01:00.670 align:middle
Now I have all these methods.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.080 align:middle
I can choose to say “No,
I only want to see those

00:01:06.247 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle
which are in
Morph". And then I see all the
22
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:14,260
methods containing either 
the Morph class, or the

00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle
morph method, and I can
see the code associated with

00:01:19.317 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle
each method.
