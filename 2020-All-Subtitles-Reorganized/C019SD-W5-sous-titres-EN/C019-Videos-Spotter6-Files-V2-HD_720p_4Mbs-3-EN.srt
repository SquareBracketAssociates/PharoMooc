00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,140
In this video, I’d like 
to show you an 

2
00:00:03,307 --> 00:00:05,060
hidden side of Spotter which is
very nice: 

3
00:00:05,227 --> 00:00:08,650
how we can use Spotter
to browse in the file system.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,680
Here I call Spotter,
now I type

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,190
./ #files, for example, it will
display the files

6
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:19,540
at the root. 

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,440
So I can see the files, 
only if it can 

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:27,460
say something…
So you see here that I

9
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:28,430
can access my files.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,780
Now I can do something even

11
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,590
nicer, I can also visit
the #Directories.

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,330
Here for example, you see I have
the cache package with my infos.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,120
Here it is a zipped format, which
is not 

14
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:45,670
really recognised directly by 
the system.

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,200
Now if I go into,

16
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:51,680
I can choose, I browse,

17
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,860
and there, when I have

18
00:00:55,027 --> 00:00:57,220
a .png for example, Spotter
is smart enough

19
00:00:57,387 --> 00:00:58,020
to discover that this is

20
00:00:58,187 --> 00:00:59,630
a .png and display it as such.

21
00:00:59,797 --> 00:01:00,890
Not displaying the bits
representing the

22
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:01,690
.png.

23
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:03,650
In the same way, 
you have a script.

24
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:08,120
What is particularly nice is that 
if you have

25
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:13,220
a Zip, you can go directly and
look inside it.

26
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,180
Here it is what I am doing,
I am

27
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:17,460
going into the Zip and once
more, it is

28
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:19,330
recursive, I can see my

29
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:22,240
.png as if I was browsing them.

30
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,020
So it is really nice.
