In this video, I’d like 
to show you an 

00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:05.060 align:middle
hidden side of Spotter which is
very nice: 

00:00:05.227 --> 00:00:08.650 align:middle
how we can use Spotter
to browse in the file system.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.680 align:middle
Here I call Spotter,
now I type

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.190 align:middle
./ #files, for example, it will
display the files

00:00:18.357 --> 00:00:19.540 align:middle
at the root. 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle
So I can see the files, 
only if it can 

00:00:23.607 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle
say something…
So you see here that I

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle
can access my files.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.780 align:middle
Now I can do something even

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle
nicer, I can also visit
the #Directories.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle
Here for example, you see I have
the cache package with my infos.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.120 align:middle
Here it is a zipped format, which
is not 

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:45.670 align:middle
really recognised directly by 
the system.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle
Now if I go into,

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle
I can choose, I browse,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle
and there, when I have

00:00:55.027 --> 00:00:57.220 align:middle
a .png for example, Spotter
is smart enough

00:00:57.387 --> 00:00:58.020 align:middle
to discover that this is

00:00:58.187 --> 00:00:59.630 align:middle
a .png and display it as such.

00:00:59.797 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle
Not displaying the bits
representing the

00:01:01.057 --> 00:01:01.690 align:middle
.png.

00:01:01.857 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle
In the same way, 
you have a script.

00:01:03.817 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle
What is particularly nice is that 
if you have

00:01:08.287 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle
a Zip, you can go directly and
look inside it.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle
Here it is what I am doing,
I am

00:01:15.347 --> 00:01:17.460 align:middle
going into the Zip and once
more, it is

00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle
recursive, I can see my

00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:22.240 align:middle
.png as if I was browsing them.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle
So it is really nice.
