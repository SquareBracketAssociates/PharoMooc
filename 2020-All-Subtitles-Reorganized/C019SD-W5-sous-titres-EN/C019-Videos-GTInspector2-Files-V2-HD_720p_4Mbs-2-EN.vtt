00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.770 align:middle
In this video, I will 
show you one very nice

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:06.700 align:middle
facet of Pharo,
its inspector.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.610 align:middle
An inspector is a tool
that enables to interact

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:14.190 align:middle
with objects, and to discuss 
with them in a lively way.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.690 align:middle
Let’s try on the file system.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle
For example, if I do “File system

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.130 align:middle
working directory", I will

00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:32.190 align:middle
get all the files that are, for 
instance, at my image’s root,

00:00:32.357 --> 00:00:33.870 align:middle
so we will get all those files.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle
Let’s have a look. If I do
“Inspect”,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle
I open an inspector.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.240 align:middle
Here I have an inspector.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle
This is the new Pharo inspector
developed

00:00:47.857 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle
by the GT team, it has

00:00:51.897 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle
very interesting features.

00:00:53.307 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle
Let’s begin to look at the tab

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.640 align:middle
called “Raw”.

00:00:59.807 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle
The “Raw” tab is the old 
inspector. What will

00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:04.850 align:middle
it show?

00:01:05.017 --> 00:01:08.000 align:middle
It shows the object data, the
object instance variables

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle
such as defined in the class.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.480 align:middle
I can interact with it.

00:01:12.647 --> 00:01:15.930 align:middle
I can, for instance,
ask for all the entries.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle
Here I get all the entries,
or give me all the

00:01:21.107 --> 00:01:25.850 align:middle
directories, for instance,
here I get all the directories.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle
If we look at the object class,
if I do “self

00:01:31.547 --> 00:01:36.240 align:middle
browse", what do I see? 

00:01:36.407 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle
This view shows me the values

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle
for the object, the instance
variables that

00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle
have been defined in the class
that way.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle
It enables me to look inside.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle
For instance, here I can see
that the “Path” is actually

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle
composed of this object “self”,
and I can see it

00:01:59.697 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle
here. I am still in raw mode, 
and

00:02:03.827 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle
I can browse inside.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.550 align:middle
If I do this, I am actually
going to look at

00:02:07.717 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle
the User string and that kind of thing.

00:02:09.947 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle
Here I essentially violate 
the encapsulation.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle
The system will look at
the introspective behavior,

00:02:18.417 --> 00:02:21.290 align:middle
it will show me the fields
values.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle
This view is very useful.

00:02:24.087 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle
But now the new inspector
does more things.

00:02:28.707 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle
This means that each object can
show to the user

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle
different facets of how it
is represented.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle
By default, every object 
has the raw facet.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle
There is also the Meta facet,
which is

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle
what enables to browse the class.

00:02:49.477 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle
We can browse quickly the class,
for instance, like this.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle
Normally, it’s just useful
when you are in the navigation

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.440 align:middle
flow, when you need to know
directly without opening

00:03:00.607 --> 00:03:01.350 align:middle
another browser.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle
But the most important are
those other tabs.

00:03:03.307 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle
Here for example, 

00:03:08.257 --> 00:03:11.640 align:middle
the inspector knowing that 
we have a reference,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle
a directory, shows everything
contained in the directory.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle
It is what I showed you there
when I did this.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle
Here, we get the same thing.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle
Now, we can browse inside

00:03:31.307 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle
this file system.

00:03:32.347 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle
If I choose Ston, this is an equivalent
of Json in Pharo,

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.920 align:middle
once more I get a

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle
reference inside the file
system, which is

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle
this file here,
I get an access on

00:03:51.277 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle
the file called 

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:57.270 align:middle
meta-inf.ston. And now the
inspector is 

00:03:57.437 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle
smart and tells me “I will
show you its content if you want.”

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle
I look at its content and 
it appears I have 

00:04:03.107 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle
a content, I don’t know exactly
what it is for, but it is a content.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.070 align:middle
In the same way, I can 
browse the sub-folders.

00:04:11.237 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle
Here, if I choose 
package-cash, this is the place where

00:04:15.117 --> 00:04:16.180 align:middle
packages are stored by default.

00:04:16.347 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle
Indeed, this is still an object 
of the file system

00:04:19.327 --> 00:04:21.760 align:middle
but it shows me its content.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle
If I look into Data, I can see

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle
one png. If I click on 
this png, I will browse.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle
Here, you see there are other tabs.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.680 align:middle

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.540 align:middle
If I click on Content,

00:04:41.707 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle
the png as stored in a binary
format on my disk.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle
As it is a png, 
the inspector shows me a preview

00:04:50.627 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle
of what the png contains.

00:04:53.737 --> 00:04:55.140 align:middle
If I look at the script.st,

00:04:55.307 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle
for example, I will have
different panes.

00:04:58.677 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle
Here there are two, I don’t 
know exactly why

00:05:00.907 --> 00:05:03.150 align:middle
but there is one with
syntax highlighting and the other

00:05:03.317 --> 00:05:05.400 align:middle
one without, showing the
content once more. 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.470 align:middle
If it is a .zip file, it
is even better because when I

00:05:09.637 --> 00:05:14.520 align:middle
on it, the zip content is
encoded and 

00:05:14.687 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle
compressed but the items,
at this point, are

00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:22.920 align:middle
interpreted. Here I can 
browse directly 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle
my objects and in the same
way recursively.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle
That was to show you that the 
Pharo inspector 

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle
is really a very powerful tool
for interacting 

00:05:37.567 --> 00:05:42.160 align:middle
precisely with objects, 
moreover as each object

00:05:42.327 --> 00:05:45.430 align:middle
determines a representation
or a set of

00:05:45.597 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle
meaningful representations
for us to

00:05:49.007 --> 00:05:51.270 align:middle
interact with it and to be 
the most efficient, 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle
this enables to build very quickly
little tools.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle
Here you have a small file systems
browser, why?

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:59.270 align:middle
Because when you browse and
inspect 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.890 align:middle
the file system, sometimes you
want to know

00:06:02.057 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle
exactly what you are inspecting.
