In this video, I will 
present a cool tool

00:00:03.777 --> 00:00:06.920 align:middle
which help you to learn
Pharo by yourself

00:00:07.087 --> 00:00:09.320 align:middle
It is ProfStef.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.210 align:middle
How to launch ProfStef?

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:14.890 align:middle
You type "ProfStef Go", select it,

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.770 align:middle
then "Do it", and you are in ProfStef.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.190 align:middle
So, ProfStef is a small
tool written in Pharo.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.450 align:middle
What is interesting is that
it only uses Pharo syntax.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.610 align:middle
All you will see,
all you will manipulate,

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:28.700 align:middle
are Pharo expressions.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle
For example, here, you have
a Pharo comment

00:00:32.027 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle
that explains to do "Hello"

00:00:34.207 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle
then, "Select the text",

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:40.020 align:middle
use right-click and 
choose "do it".

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.930 align:middle
We will do it using 
keyboard shortcuts.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.180 align:middle
Et voilà, I moved to 
the second lesson.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.230 align:middle
Now you understood the principle,

00:00:53.397 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle
some comments, and now some 
expressions to execute.

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle
If I do "Do it',
it opens a workspace and 

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle
I can type text inside, I close it.

00:01:01.197 --> 00:01:05.810 align:middle
This expression opens

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.260 align:middle
a window that displays 
the system version I am using

00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle
to record this video.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle
And to go to next lesson: 
I select the expression, or not,

00:01:15.177 --> 00:01:18.660 align:middle
I can just put the caret 
on the line, "Do it", and  

00:01:18.827 --> 00:01:21.010 align:middle
I go to the next lesson. 
This new lesson,

00:01:21.177 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle
tells you that you were able
to achieve "Do it"

00:01:24.107 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle
Now, I will do "Print".

00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle
Same as before, you have results
and you will see and interact.

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:31.400 align:middle
So here, for example,
What is the current date?

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle
March, 5th.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle
Voilà, you have seen all you need

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle
to achieve to ProfStef lessons
by yourself.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.940 align:middle
And you will see that it is fun ;-)

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.330 align:middle
I would like to thank
Laurent Lafont who is

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle
the author of ProfStef because
it is a really cool tool.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle
So, we will do 
"ProfStef says: #Thanks to:

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle
#Laurent". Thanks again.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle
Obviously, this 
expression cannot be executed

00:02:02.507 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle
directly, so let's go to
the next lesson.
