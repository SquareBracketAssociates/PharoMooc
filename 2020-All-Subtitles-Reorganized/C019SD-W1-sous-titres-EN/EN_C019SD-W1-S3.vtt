WEBVTT

00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.880 align:middle
Hello.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.720 align:middle
In this lecture I want to show you
the vision behind Pharo.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.760 align:middle
Why are people taking part in Pharo?

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.480 align:middle
This will help you to understand

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.720 align:middle
where Pharo is going
and why people use it.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.240 align:middle
The basic idea is to create

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.760 align:middle
a tool, an infrastructure,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle
which will enable people
to reinvent their future,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.360 align:middle
to use the web in new ways,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle
to create new tools,
new forms of computation and so on...

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle
For this, the notion of an engine
is very important.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle
It means the infrastructure,
the compiler, the services

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle
and that sort of thing.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle
On a twin track, there's the idea
of creating an ecosystem

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle
in which innovation
creates new things

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle
to give us a competitive edge,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle
and in which business can bloom.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.720 align:middle
So how do we understand
this metaphor of ecosystem?

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle
Via the teachers. There are
30 universities around the world

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.920 align:middle
which teach Pharo.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle
Via the research groups.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.960 align:middle
There are 15 or so research groups

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle
doing software engineering,
but not only that,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle
around the world.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle
And via the companies.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.400 align:middle
The basic idea of Pharo

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle
is not to be an academic language,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle
but to be a language used by people
in order to make money

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.640 align:middle
and live off their programming.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.120 align:middle
You can see some success stories
on the website.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle
Here's the address.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle
You can really see
what people do with it.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle
I'm often surprised
at what people do with Pharo.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle
It's not just cool
because we say it is.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.120 align:middle
People do real stuff with it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle
You have to realise
that for the development team

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle
Pharo is a vehicle.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.320 align:middle
We're the guys in black
around the Formula 1 car.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle
We improve it every day.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle
Pharo isn't something finished,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.480 align:middle
it's something
that's constantly being improved.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle
It's quite young
for a programming language.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle
It began in 2008.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.880 align:middle
The more it advances,
the more exciting its future looks.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle
I'll say a bit about that.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle
Most companies
do web content now with Pharo

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.760 align:middle
because the web stack is excellent.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle
We're going to use Seaside

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle
in this course,
but we can also use REST.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle
There are several HTTP servers
that are used.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.720 align:middle
It's a company that developed
Pharo the HTTP server.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle
There's the micro server Teapot.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.440 align:middle
You have the WebSockets
and identifications.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle
Metadescription of data to avoid
generating automatic forms.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle
Connections to databases,
whether SQL or relational.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.600 align:middle
And loads of protocols.
Some come out every day.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle
People make packages
which cover these functions.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.200 align:middle
Pharo is open.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.600 align:middle
What this means is that you can help
and have an impact,

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle
but at least read
and have access to Pharo.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle
One important thing

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.280 align:middle
which people have trouble
putting into concrete terms

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle
is that Pharo is a system
which enables you.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle
Here I'm showing you
a quotation from an American

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.240 align:middle
who changed
a very fundamental aspect of Pharo:

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.560 align:middle
the delay.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.480 align:middle
It's a function for adjusting
the concurrency in the system.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.720 align:middle
He found that it couldn't
be tested in isolation.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle
He suggested changes in Pharo

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle
so these functions
could be tested individually.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle
And his changes
were incorporated into Pharo.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.360 align:middle
What's really interesting
- I'll let you read the quotation -

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle
is that he says he was really amazed

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.800 align:middle
that he could simply think of doing it
and do it.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle
And similarly, with this slide,
Turtles all the way down,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle
meaning there are objects
all the way down,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.800 align:middle
the creator of Seaside, who knew
ruby, python, scheme, objective-C,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle
developed Seaside
in Pharo's ancestor.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.920 align:middle
I asked him why he used Pharo.
He said, "Because I could."

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.400 align:middle
"I can manipulate the stack
behind the programmers' backs

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.920 align:middle
"and suggest an abstraction
I couldn't in another language."

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle
This empowering
is really very interesting.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.960 align:middle
I want to talk
about the mid-term vision of Pharo.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle
What will Pharo be in about 5 years?

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.280 align:middle
The core will be bootstrapped.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.040 align:middle
Meaning we'll be able
to reconstruct it from itself.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle
Which isn't possible
at the moment.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle
We'll have a better integration
with OSes and C.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle
We can imagine launching a Pharo app
in any C application.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle
It'll be a more modular system
with validated distributions.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle
If someone writes
an XML parser, for example,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle
you'll want to know
if it's passed all the tests,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle
if it functions
in whatever version of Pharo,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.880 align:middle
if the non-regression rules
are satisfied...

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle
So really using software engineering
to validate

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle
what is made around the world,

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle
so the people using Pharo can be
assured of the level of quality.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle
There's an effort now to make tools
more powerful than they presently are.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle
The idea is to have a system

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.920 align:middle
that can adapt
as well to a coffee machine

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.840 align:middle
as to the cloud.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle
The Pharo development team
is working on this sort of thing.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.280 align:middle
It'll soon be available
for everyone.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle
So Pharo, with its aim
to have an impact on real life

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle
and involve companies,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle
has created an industrial consortium.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.200 align:middle
The idea is to promote Pharo,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle
to sustain its constant development,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle
to improve its visibility
and provide support.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle
Here are some members
of the Pharo consortium.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle
There are small companies
but big ones too, like Lam Research and Thales.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle
And a lot of universities
and research groups.
