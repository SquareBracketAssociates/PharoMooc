00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,340
I’d like to show you tips
to be more efficient

2
00:00:04,507 --> 00:00:07,640
when you select an expression
to execute it.

3
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,270
So, let’s imagine we have this
3-lines expression.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,560
If I want to execute the first 
line, what can I do?

5
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:15,090
I can place the cursor at the 
beginning of the line

6
00:00:15,257 --> 00:00:18,010
and select the end,
or the end and select toward the beginning.

7
00:00:18,177 --> 00:00:20,350
So here it works.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,760
Now, what I can do: I can
double-click

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,220
at the end of the line to select it.

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,000
And even better : I can place
the cursor

11
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:34,040
anywhere on the line and execute it.

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,630
I press “Escape” to unselect.

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,880
Now, if I want to select 2 lines,

14
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:43,860
I will select normally, as I’ve
shown you before.

15
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,020
So here I get 1000.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,440
And now, if I want to select 
the whole expression,

17
00:00:49,607 --> 00:00:50,240
what can I do?

18
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:51,840
I can do the same thing than 
previously or I

19
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:54,390
can place the cursor at the end 
of the expression,

20
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:58,230
and double-click, or at the beginning
of the expression and double-click.
