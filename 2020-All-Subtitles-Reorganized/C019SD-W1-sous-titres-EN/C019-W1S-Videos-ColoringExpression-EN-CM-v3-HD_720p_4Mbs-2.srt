00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,390
I will show you 2 visual tips 

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,770
that will give you feedback when
you type expressions. 

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,080
Let’s imagine that I write C, uppercase,
that’s the start 

4
00:00:10,247 --> 00:00:13,130
of a class name. It is in italics
because it shows that

5
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:15,570
in the system there are indeed 
classes beginning with letter C.

6
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:18,870
So now, if I write Color,
we see that there is

7
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:21,370
one and the system detects one.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,100
If I write Colox,
it is red, meaning: “I don’t

9
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:28,430
have classes beginning with this 
prefix. 

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,370
There is the same thing for methods.

11
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:33,950
If I write nx, it will be red.

12
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:39,000
“nne” also. However,
“ne” shows that “New” exists.
