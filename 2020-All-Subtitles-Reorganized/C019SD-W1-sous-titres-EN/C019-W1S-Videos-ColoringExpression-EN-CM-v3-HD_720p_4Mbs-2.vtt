I will show you 2 visual tips 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.770 align:middle
that will give you feedback when
you type expressions. 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.080 align:middle
Let’s imagine that I write C, uppercase,
that’s the start 

00:00:10.247 --> 00:00:13.130 align:middle
of a class name. It is in italics
because it shows that

00:00:13.297 --> 00:00:15.570 align:middle
in the system there are indeed 
classes beginning with letter C.

00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:18.870 align:middle
So now, if I write Color,
we see that there is

00:00:19.037 --> 00:00:21.370 align:middle
one and the system detects one.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.100 align:middle
If I write Colox,
it is red, meaning: “I don’t

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle
have classes beginning with this 
prefix. 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.370 align:middle
There is the same thing for methods.

00:00:31.537 --> 00:00:33.950 align:middle
If I write nx, it will be red.

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle
“nne” also. However,
“ne” shows that “New” exists.
