00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,880
Hello.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,720
In this lecture I want to show you
the vision behind Pharo.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,760
Why are people taking part in Pharo?

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,480
This will help you to understand

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,720
where Pharo is going
and why people use it.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,240
The basic idea is to create

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,760
a tool, an infrastructure,

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,000
which will enable people
to reinvent their future,

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,360
to use the web in new ways,

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,520
to create new tools,
new forms of computation and so on...

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,880
For this, the notion of an engine
is very important.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,440
It means the infrastructure,
the compiler, the services

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,960
and that sort of thing.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,760
On a twin track, there's the idea
of creating an ecosystem

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,400
in which innovation
creates new things

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,560
to give us a competitive edge,

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,960
and in which business can bloom.

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,720
So how do we understand
this metaphor of ecosystem?

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,320
Via the teachers. There are
30 universities around the world

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,920
which teach Pharo.

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,600
Via the research groups.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,960
There are 15 or so research groups

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,160
doing software engineering,
but not only that,

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
around the world.

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,480
And via the companies.

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,400
The basic idea of Pharo

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,240
is not to be an academic language,

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,200
but to be a language used by people
in order to make money

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,640
and live off their programming.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,120
You can see some success stories
on the website.

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,360
Here's the address.

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,360
You can really see
what people do with it.

33
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,480
I'm often surprised
at what people do with Pharo.

34
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,800
It's not just cool
because we say it is.

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,120
People do real stuff with it.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,840
You have to realise
that for the development team

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,840
Pharo is a vehicle.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,320
We're the guys in black
around the Formula 1 car.

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,960
We improve it every day.

40
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Pharo isn't something finished,

41
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,480
it's something
that's constantly being improved.

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,440
It's quite young
for a programming language.

43
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
It began in 2008.

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,880
The more it advances,
the more exciting its future looks.

45
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,160
I'll say a bit about that.

46
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,800
Most companies
do web content now with Pharo

47
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,760
because the web stack is excellent.

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,200
We're going to use Seaside

49
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,480
in this course,
but we can also use REST.

50
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,200
There are several HTTP servers
that are used.

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,720
It's a company that developed
Pharo the HTTP server.

52
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,400
There's the micro server Teapot.

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,440
You have the WebSockets
and identifications.

54
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,960
Metadescription of data to avoid
generating automatic forms.

55
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,480
Connections to databases,
whether SQL or relational.

56
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,600
And loads of protocols.
Some come out every day.

57
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,720
People make packages
which cover these functions.

58
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,200
Pharo is open.

59
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,600
What this means is that you can help
and have an impact,

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,120
but at least read
and have access to Pharo.

61
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,200
One important thing

62
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,280
which people have trouble
putting into concrete terms

63
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,840
is that Pharo is a system
which enables you.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Here I'm showing you
a quotation from an American

65
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,240
who changed
a very fundamental aspect of Pharo:

66
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,560
the delay.

67
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,480
It's a function for adjusting
the concurrency in the system.

68
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,720
He found that it couldn't
be tested in isolation.

69
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,680
He suggested changes in Pharo

70
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,960
so these functions
could be tested individually.

71
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,280
And his changes
were incorporated into Pharo.

72
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,360
What's really interesting
- I'll let you read the quotation -

73
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,720
is that he says he was really amazed

74
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,800
that he could simply think of doing it
and do it.

75
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,120
And similarly, with this slide,
Turtles all the way down,

76
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,720
meaning there are objects
all the way down,

77
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,800
the creator of Seaside, who knew
ruby, python, scheme, objective-C,

78
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,120
developed Seaside
in Pharo's ancestor.

79
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,920
I asked him why he used Pharo.
He said, "Because I could."

80
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,400
"I can manipulate the stack
behind the programmers' backs

81
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,920
"and suggest an abstraction
I couldn't in another language."

82
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,920
This empowering
is really very interesting.

83
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,960
I want to talk
about the mid-term vision of Pharo.

84
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,000
What will Pharo be in about 5 years?

85
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,280
The core will be bootstrapped.

86
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,040
Meaning we'll be able
to reconstruct it from itself.

87
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,440
Which isn't possible
at the moment.

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,200
We'll have a better integration
with OSes and C.

89
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,200
We can imagine launching a Pharo app
in any C application.

90
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,680
It'll be a more modular system
with validated distributions.

91
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,240
If someone writes
an XML parser, for example,

92
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,360
you'll want to know
if it's passed all the tests,

93
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,200
if it functions
in whatever version of Pharo,

94
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,880
if the non-regression rules
are satisfied...

95
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,440
So really using software engineering
to validate

96
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,680
what is made around the world,

97
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,320
so the people using Pharo can be
assured of the level of quality.

98
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,640
There's an effort now to make tools
more powerful than they presently are.

99
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,360
The idea is to have a system

100
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,920
that can adapt
as well to a coffee machine

101
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,840
as to the cloud.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,960
The Pharo development team
is working on this sort of thing.

103
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,280
It'll soon be available
for everyone.

104
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,560
So Pharo, with its aim
to have an impact on real life

105
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,520
and involve companies,

106
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,040
has created an industrial consortium.

107
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,200
The idea is to promote Pharo,

108
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,400
to sustain its constant development,

109
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,200
to improve its visibility
and provide support.

110
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,080
Here are some members
of the Pharo consortium.

111
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,720
There are small companies
but big ones too, like Lam Research and Thales.

112
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,960
And a lot of universities
and research groups.
