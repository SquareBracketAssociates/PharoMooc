00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,610
In this video, I will 
present a cool tool

2
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:06,920
which help you to learn
Pharo by yourself

3
00:00:07,087 --> 00:00:09,320
It is ProfStef.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,210
How to launch ProfStef?

5
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:14,890
You type "ProfStef Go", select it,

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,770
then "Do it", and you are in ProfStef.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,190
So, ProfStef is a small
tool written in Pharo.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,450
What is interesting is that
it only uses Pharo syntax.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,610
All you will see,
all you will manipulate,

10
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:28,700
are Pharo expressions.

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,860
For example, here, you have
a Pharo comment

12
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:34,040
that explains to do "Hello"

13
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:37,120
then, "Select the text",

14
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,020
use right-click and 
choose "do it".

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,930
We will do it using 
keyboard shortcuts.

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,180
Et voilà, I moved to 
the second lesson.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,230
Now you understood the principle,

18
00:00:53,397 --> 00:00:56,790
some comments, and now some 
expressions to execute.

19
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,250
If I do "Do it',
it opens a workspace and 

20
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:01,030
I can type text inside, I close it.

21
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:05,810
This expression opens

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,260
a window that displays 
the system version I am using

23
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:09,650
to record this video.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,010
And to go to next lesson: 
I select the expression, or not,

25
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:18,660
I can just put the caret 
on the line, "Do it", and  

26
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:21,010
I go to the next lesson. 
This new lesson,

27
00:01:21,177 --> 00:01:23,940
tells you that you were able
to achieve "Do it"

28
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:25,000
Now, I will do "Print".

29
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:29,890
Same as before, you have results
and you will see and interact.

30
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,400
So here, for example,
What is the current date?

31
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:32,220
March, 5th.

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,860
Voilà, you have seen all you need

33
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,940
to achieve to ProfStef lessons
by yourself.

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,940
And you will see that it is fun ;-)

35
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,330
I would like to thank
Laurent Lafont who is

36
00:01:42,497 --> 00:01:45,490
the author of ProfStef because
it is a really cool tool.

37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,000
So, we will do 
"ProfStef says: #Thanks to:

38
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,300
#Laurent". Thanks again.

39
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,340
Obviously, this 
expression cannot be executed

40
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:05,900
directly, so let's go to
the next lesson.
