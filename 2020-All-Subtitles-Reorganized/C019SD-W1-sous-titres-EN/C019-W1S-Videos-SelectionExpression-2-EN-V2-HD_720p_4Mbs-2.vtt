I’d like to show you tips
to be more efficient

00:00:04.507 --> 00:00:07.640 align:middle
when you select an expression
to execute it.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.270 align:middle
So, let’s imagine we have this
3-lines expression.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.560 align:middle
If I want to execute the first 
line, what can I do?

00:00:12.727 --> 00:00:15.090 align:middle
I can place the cursor at the 
beginning of the line

00:00:15.257 --> 00:00:18.010 align:middle
and select the end,
or the end and select toward the beginning.

00:00:18.177 --> 00:00:20.350 align:middle
So here it works.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.760 align:middle
Now, what I can do: I can
double-click

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle
at the end of the line to select it.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.000 align:middle
And even better : I can place
the cursor

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle
anywhere on the line and execute it.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle
I press “Escape” to unselect.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle
Now, if I want to select 2 lines,

00:00:41.047 --> 00:00:43.860 align:middle
I will select normally, as I’ve
shown you before.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle
So here I get 1000.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle
And now, if I want to select 
the whole expression,

00:00:49.607 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle
what can I do?

00:00:50.407 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle
I can do the same thing than 
previously or I

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle
can place the cursor at the end 
of the expression,

00:00:54.557 --> 00:00:58.230 align:middle
and double-click, or at the beginning
of the expression and double-click.
