WEBVTT

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.280 align:middle
In this session
we'll look at what Pharo is.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.080 align:middle
It's a pure object language.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.720 align:middle
But it's also an IDE,
an integrated development environment.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.040 align:middle
It's inspired by Smalltalk.
That's its spiritual father.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.520 align:middle
It's a powerful and elegant language
that's fun to program.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.320 align:middle
There's a great community of people
who do a variety of things with it.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.480 align:middle
What we'll try to teach you on
this course, with the help of videos,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle
is that it's a living system
you can script as you go.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle
You can take Pharo with its MIT
licence and do what you want with it.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle
When I say that Pharo is elegant
I have arguments to back that up.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle
The syntax fits on a postcard

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.840 align:middle
and the simple
and powerful object model

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle
takes up four lines.
I'll show you...

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.800 align:middle
On this slide
you have the full Pharo syntax.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle
I mean "full", there's nothing else.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.840 align:middle
That doesn't mean you can understand
the syntax just by reading this slide.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle
We'll have several sessions,
deciphering

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle
and helping you understand
how the syntax is structured.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle
But it gives you an idea
of the work to be done.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.320 align:middle
There's nothing else
but this syntax.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.960 align:middle
Likewise, the object model
is summed up on that slide.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle
Everything is dynamically typed,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle
everything is an object instance
of a class,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle
all methods are public virtual,
all attributes are protected,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle
and there's single inheritance.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle
There's no boxing,
no primitive and non-primitive type,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle
no generic type, and so on.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.160 align:middle
You have everything.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle
You just saw
the Pharo syntax and model.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.720 align:middle
We'll come back to that,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle
but it's just to give you an idea
of the system's complexity.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.200 align:middle
You have to realise that Pharo
is entirely written in itself.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.160 align:middle
What do I mean by Pharo?
I mean the strings, characters,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.000 align:middle
booleans, IDE, compiler, sockets...

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.040 align:middle
Everything is written in Pharo.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.600 align:middle
So if you master this syntax,
written on one page, and this model,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle
then you'll have access
to the entirety of Pharo.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle
I think that this is exciting
intellectually

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.040 align:middle
because you have
this tiny entrance door

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.080 align:middle
into a gigantic world.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle
So if you look
at the title of this mooc,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle
it includes the word "immersive".
Why is this?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle
Because Pharo isn't a blackbox.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle
The entire system
is fully inspectable,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle
so you can go and see
how it's implemented.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle
And Pharo is reflective.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle
It has a representation of itself

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle
that you can use
in order to understand it.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle
This means you can get completely
immersed in a world of objects.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle
I like this metaphor of the fish tank.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle
A language is usually a blackbox.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle
Pharo isn't a blackbox,
it's a fish tank,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.560 align:middle
where you can see the objects
and constituents of the system itself,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle
but you can also dive into the tank
and interact with the objects.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.520 align:middle
So it's really in that sense

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle
that we're inviting you
to play with Pharo.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.920 align:middle
Here I'm showing you an example
of an immersive system.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle
What we call immersive
or interactive.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle
On the left you have the code.
On the right, what it produces.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle
Each time the programmer
presses the compilation key,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle
the screen goes blue
and the result is on the right.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle
He's constantly modifying his code

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle
and seeing what he's doing
in the right-hand window.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.800 align:middle
You can do this
with any element of the system,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle
whether it's a socket, a file...

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.240 align:middle
3D, like here.
But a web server would be the same.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle
The web server functions
and you can modify it as you go.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.960 align:middle
Now I'll show you
the supports available

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.600 align:middle
if you want to work Pharo
outside this mooc.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.520 align:middle
There are several books,
all open source.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.440 align:middle
There's <i>Pharo by Example</i>,
for beginners, in several languages.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.800 align:middle
It's currently being updated
for Pharo 5.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle
<i>Deep into Pharo </i>is more advanced,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.840 align:middle
going into the libraries,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle
into less-known aspects
of the language and the tools.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle
There's
<i>Enterprise Pharo, a Web Perspective,</i>

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle
which puts the emphasis
on web libraries,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.280 align:middle
like WebSockets,
HTTP/HTTPS servers

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle
and templating.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle
They're all open source.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle
What we'll use mainly for this course
is a web framework, <i>Seaside</i>.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle
You have 300 pages available
at the indicated address.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.840 align:middle
You can read the book
if you want to know more.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle
But we'll give you all you need
to follow the mooc

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.400 align:middle
without having to read the book too.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle
For those interested
in other aspects,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle
there's this book of about 300 pages
about the numerical methods in Pharo,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.600 align:middle
going from things
like statistical series,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle
to iterative algorithms and clustering.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle
I told you that Pharo
is a system to learn from.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle
I'll give you a few illustrations.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.880 align:middle
We'll see them again
in the videos.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle
Every graphic element of Pharo
that you click on...

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.320 align:middle
With Cmd+Shift+Option,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle
you'll get a little menu
around the graphic element.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.320 align:middle
By using these menus,
you can go directly inside

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle
and manipulate the visual elements
you're dealing with.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.680 align:middle
We'll show you what
an Inspector is,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle
an object that lets you manipulate
the properties of other objects,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle
and start to implement them.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle
We also have an object
called a Finder.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.680 align:middle
So I can ask the Finder

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle
to find all the system's methods
that contain the word "match".

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle
It shows me a list, and I can access
the method's code directly.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.800 align:middle
There's also a tool called Spotter,
which you get with Shift+Enter.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.000 align:middle
And you tell it what you want.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.200 align:middle
Spotter will help you find
classes, methods or resources.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.800 align:middle
You'll have videos
to explain all that.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.600 align:middle
But, again,
Spotter is written in Pharo itself.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.680 align:middle
The Finder has quite a nice function,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle
when you start learning Pharo.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.560 align:middle
There'll be a video about this too.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.240 align:middle
You can give examples and say:

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.720 align:middle
"This is what I want to do but I don't
know how to write it in Pharo."

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle
The Finder will look for methods.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle
I have an example.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.120 align:middle
I say: "I have two strings, AB and C.
I'd like to concatenate them."

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle
And I know that the result
should be the string ABC.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle
It sounds simple.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.320 align:middle
So I say to the system:

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle
"Give me the message,
if one exists,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle
"which will let me
concatenate these strings."

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.000 align:middle
And that's what you can see here.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle
It says “,” is a method implemented
in SequencableCollection.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle
This will be sent to my first string,

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.480 align:middle
and I'll get my third string.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle
You'll be able to use this Finder
on examples,

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle
to make you quicker in Pharo.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.520 align:middle
In this Mooc we'll talk
about object oriented design, which is part

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle
of the DNA of Pharo.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.080 align:middle
People who program in Pharo
think OO in an elegant way.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle
I'll show you the exercises
we'll be presenting.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle
We're often asked
how not is implemented.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.240 align:middle
People often wonder
if this is an interesting question.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.240 align:middle
It is interesting because
fundamental rules result from it.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.720 align:middle
It'll be part of the exercise.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle
Once you have Pharo
and you see how not is implemented,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle
you'll start thinking
in a different way.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle
This really is part of the culture
of people who use Pharo:

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.800 align:middle
to think a design
in a really elegant way.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.480 align:middle
You can install Pharo
as described on the Pharo website.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle
Of course, during the MOOC
and on the FUN site,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle
you'll get all the instructions

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle
for installing Pharo on any system.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.920 align:middle
Pharo is very easy to install,

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle
as a drag and drop,
onto any OS.
