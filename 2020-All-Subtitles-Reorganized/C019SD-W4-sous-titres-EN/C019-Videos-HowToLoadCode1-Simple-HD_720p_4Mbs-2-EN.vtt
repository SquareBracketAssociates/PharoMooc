00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.110 align:middle
I'd like to show you how
we load code in Pharo.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.250 align:middle
I go on Safari to see.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.430 align:middle
I want to load the Counter
which has been saved in the

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:16.070 align:middle
Pharo MOOC project, on Smalltalk Hub.

00:00:16.237 --> 00:00:19.160 align:middle
Here it shows the repository,
I copy it.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.460 align:middle
I go there. I do
Monticello Browser +Repository Http.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle
And I paste the definition.

00:00:29.687 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle
Here, I click on OK. And now
what will the system show?

00:00:33.817 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle
It will show "Yes, there's a
version - here unfortunately

00:00:37.017 --> 00:00:39.040 align:middle
there is only one -
one version of Pharo Counter."

00:00:39.207 --> 00:00:42.280 align:middle
I can do a merge which will
make a Diff between

00:00:42.447 --> 00:00:44.350 align:middle
what will be loaded and
what is in the image.

00:00:44.517 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle
Here, there are only additions,
but if there were

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle
modifications of existing
methods it will 

00:00:50.207 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle
show them and it will make
an interactive Diff.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle
I can also do a Load, 

00:00:55.427 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle
with this it will overwrite
the things that are in the image.

00:00:57.797 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle
MyCounter, there was only this,
so I can do Load and here it is.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle
Now I have loaded my code, 
I do

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle
Counter.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle
If I go in Counter, my tests
are green, I can

00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:18.520 align:middle
begin to work.
