1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,210
Here I want to show you 
how to load

2
00:00:03,377 --> 00:00:06,000
packages deployed by other
people.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,730
In Pharo, there is what we call
the Catalog Browser.

4
00:00:10,897 --> 00:00:13,160
We're gonna open the Catalog Browser.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,070
Here it will look on the Internet
and get the 

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,480
catalog metadata,
and show us all the

7
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:24,520
packages deployed by people
that you can deploy too.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,890
In fact, what happens is that
when you deploy a

9
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:30,870
package in a particular repository,
it will be

10
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:34,680
available in the catalog.
Now

11
00:00:34,847 --> 00:00:39,740
let's imagine I'm looking for
XML, I will get all these

12
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:40,950
Parsers, here I have tags.

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,260
I see that XMLParser
works for Pharo 5, I could have

14
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:49,280
also searched for XHTML
validation, and I would have get it.

15
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:51,680
I click on it, 
I have a little document.

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,000
I can install the new version
and

17
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:59,230
create a group if I want to or
only install the

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
stable release, or 
change the configuration.

19
00:01:02,747 --> 00:01:06,260
The configuration is the map managing 
the dependencies between packages.

20
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,290
We install the stable
configuration.

21
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,280
It will take a little time.

22
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,350
Here it will get the packages on 
distributed repository

23
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,290
and load everything in memory.

24
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,900
I launch my tests because there
is no reason otherwise.

25
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:37,230
I want to know if what that package
does makes sense.

26
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,630
I go there. I select all.

27
00:01:39,797 --> 00:01:40,900
I click on Run Selected.

28
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,800
I have 2 187 tests which are
green, so it must work.
