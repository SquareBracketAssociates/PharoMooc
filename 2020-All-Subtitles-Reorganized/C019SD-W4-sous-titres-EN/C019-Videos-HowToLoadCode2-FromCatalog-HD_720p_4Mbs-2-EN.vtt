00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.210 align:middle
Here I want to show you 
how to load

00:00:03.377 --> 00:00:06.000 align:middle
packages deployed by other
people.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.730 align:middle
In Pharo, there is what we call
the Catalog Browser.

00:00:10.897 --> 00:00:13.160 align:middle
We're gonna open the Catalog Browser.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.070 align:middle
Here it will look on the Internet
and get the 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.480 align:middle
catalog metadata,
and show us all the

00:00:20.647 --> 00:00:24.520 align:middle
packages deployed by people
that you can deploy too.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.890 align:middle
In fact, what happens is that
when you deploy a

00:00:28.057 --> 00:00:30.870 align:middle
package in a particular repository,
it will be

00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle
available in the catalog.
Now

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle
let's imagine I'm looking for
XML, I will get all these

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:40.950 align:middle
Parsers, here I have tags.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle
I see that XMLParser
works for Pharo 5, I could have

00:00:45.427 --> 00:00:49.280 align:middle
also searched for XHTML
validation, and I would have get it.

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle
I click on it, 
I have a little document.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle
I can install the new version
and

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:59.230 align:middle
create a group if I want to or
only install the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.580 align:middle
stable release, or 
change the configuration.

00:01:02.747 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle
The configuration is the map managing 
the dependencies between packages.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle
We install the stable
configuration.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle
It will take a little time.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle
Here it will get the packages on 
distributed repository

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.290 align:middle
and load everything in memory.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle
I launch my tests because there
is no reason otherwise.

00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle
I want to know if what that package
does makes sense.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle
I go there. I select all.

00:01:39.797 --> 00:01:40.900 align:middle
I click on Run Selected.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.800 align:middle
I have 2 187 tests which are
green, so it must work.
