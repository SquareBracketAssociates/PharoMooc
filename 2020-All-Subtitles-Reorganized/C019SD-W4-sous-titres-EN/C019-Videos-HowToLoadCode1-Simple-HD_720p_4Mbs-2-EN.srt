1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,110
I'd like to show you how
we load code in Pharo.

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,250
I go on Safari to see.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,430
I want to load the Counter
which has been saved in the

4
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,070
Pharo MOOC project, on Smalltalk Hub.

5
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:19,160
Here it shows the repository,
I copy it.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,460
I go there. I do
Monticello Browser +Repository Http.

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,520
And I paste the definition.

8
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:33,650
Here, I click on OK. And now
what will the system show?

9
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:36,850
It will show "Yes, there's a
version - here unfortunately

10
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:39,040
there is only one -
one version of Pharo Counter."

11
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:42,280
I can do a merge which will
make a Diff between

12
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:44,350
what will be loaded and
what is in the image.

13
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:47,880
Here, there are only additions,
but if there were

14
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,040
modifications of existing
methods it will 

15
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:52,640
show them and it will make
an interactive Diff.

16
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,260
I can also do a Load, 

17
00:00:55,427 --> 00:00:57,630
with this it will overwrite
the things that are in the image.

18
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:01,410
MyCounter, there was only this,
so I can do Load and here it is.

19
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,830
Now I have loaded my code, 
I do

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,270
Counter.

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,690
If I go in Counter, my tests
are green, I can

22
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:18,520
begin to work.
