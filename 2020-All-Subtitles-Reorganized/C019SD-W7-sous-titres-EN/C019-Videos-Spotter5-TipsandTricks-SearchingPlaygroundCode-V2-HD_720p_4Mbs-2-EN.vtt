Another nice feature of Playground

00:00:03.077 --> 00:00:06.750 align:middle
is that you can search in your
your bits of code.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.640 align:middle
For example, if I search
what I have typed in

00:00:11.807 --> 00:00:14.510 align:middle
Playground recently containing 
"Counter", I type #pl

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.320 align:middle
for Playground, it displays
expressions.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle
I can even see the expressions there
and choose the one that makes sense.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle
And I type "Enter" and I get the expression.
