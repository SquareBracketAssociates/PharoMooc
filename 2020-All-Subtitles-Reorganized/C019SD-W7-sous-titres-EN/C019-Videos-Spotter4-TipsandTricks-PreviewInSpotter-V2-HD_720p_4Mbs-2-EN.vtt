I'd like to show you some
tips in 

00:00:03.357 --> 00:00:04.800 align:middle
Spotter.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.690 align:middle
First, if you click on the
Shift key, Spotter

00:00:09.857 --> 00:00:11.740 align:middle
will display all the places
where you

00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:16.850 align:middle
can click.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:21.000 align:middle
For example, let's imagine that
I want to understand the "Do"

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle
method, the implementors,
if I click on the arrow, here

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.450 align:middle
it displays most
of the implementors.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.870 align:middle
Now what is really nice is 
that I can

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.290 align:middle
activate the panel and see directly

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle
the code.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.470 align:middle
It can be the code because here
I browse

00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:44.840 align:middle
methods, but if I browsed
files,

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle
I would get the rendering of the files
or their content.
