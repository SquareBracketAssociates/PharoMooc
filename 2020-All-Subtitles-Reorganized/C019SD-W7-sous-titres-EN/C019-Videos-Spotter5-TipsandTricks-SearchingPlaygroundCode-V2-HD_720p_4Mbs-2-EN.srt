1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,910
Another nice feature of Playground

2
00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:06,750
is that you can search in your
your bits of code.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,640
For example, if I search
what I have typed in

4
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:14,510
Playground recently containing 
"Counter", I type #pl

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,320
for Playground, it displays
expressions.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,680
I can even see the expressions there
and choose the one that makes sense.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,110
And I type "Enter" and I get the expression.
