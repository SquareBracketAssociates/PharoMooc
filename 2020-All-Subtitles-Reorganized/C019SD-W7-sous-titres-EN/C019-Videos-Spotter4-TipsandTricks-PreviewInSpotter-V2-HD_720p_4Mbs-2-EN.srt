00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,190
I'd like to show you some
tips in 

2
00:00:03,357 --> 00:00:04,800
Spotter.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,690
First, if you click on the
Shift key, Spotter

4
00:00:09,857 --> 00:00:11,740
will display all the places
where you

5
00:00:11,907 --> 00:00:16,850
can click.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:21,000
For example, let's imagine that
I want to understand the "Do"

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,020
method, the implementors,
if I click on the arrow, here

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,450
it displays most
of the implementors.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,870
Now what is really nice is 
that I can

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,290
activate the panel and see directly

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,000
the code.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,470
It can be the code because here
I browse

13
00:00:42,637 --> 00:00:44,840
methods, but if I browsed
files,

14
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:48,460
I would get the rendering of the files
or their content.
