Hello, this is the final chapter
in our journey into the world of Pharo.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.280 align:middle
It will complete the courses
we have presented.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.600 align:middle
It's important to understand

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.160 align:middle
that the hard part is over
now you know the key aspects of Pharo.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.080 align:middle
We've covered pretty much everything,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle
except some
software engineering concepts,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.640 align:middle
like package dependency
and continuous integration.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.400 align:middle
You'll find them on www.pharo.org.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.480 align:middle
You will have learned
almost all of the core libraries.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.600 align:middle
There are others,
but they are extensions,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.800 align:middle
which have the same level of complexity.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle
For these, you'll need to learn
the specific libraries.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle
I hope you see Pharo
as an immersive system.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle
It allows you
to constantly interact with objects.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle
Particularly by coding in the debugger.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.960 align:middle
The debugger is a key to productivity,
so make sure you use it!

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.320 align:middle
There's also another important aspect.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.760 align:middle
If you use Pharo for business,
contact us if you need help.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle
Pharo is a community of people
who do business in a concrete way.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.200 align:middle
Pharo is a young language
that is evolving.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle
Infrastructure is constantly improving,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.160 align:middle
as in its compiler, tools, and libraries.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.480 align:middle
Our community
is also constantly growing.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.640 align:middle
This slide shows Pharo's mid-term vision
with a list of projects in development

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle
that will be realized in a year or two.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.040 align:middle
Briefly, these include scripting syntax,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle
an improved module system,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.080 align:middle
integration with versioning systems,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.280 align:middle
and integration with OSes.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle
All these features will be completed
within two years.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.400 align:middle
Today, Pharo is no longer
a small team working in France.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.000 align:middle
We have 70 regular contributors
across the globe who improve Pharo.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.080 align:middle
This community works on
numerous projects.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle
We don't even know what they all are!

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.000 align:middle
Our message
is that you can participate, too.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle
You can take on a project
with other people.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle
It's very rewarding on many levels.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.520 align:middle
You can contribute to the system
and it's fun!

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle
I hope you enjoyed this journey
and learned a lot.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.800 align:middle
I hope Pharo helps you to reflect
on the future of programming.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle
Everything is accessible in Pharo.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.160 align:middle
It allows you to do things
you can't do elsewhere.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle
But Pharo is more than that!
It's fun and elegant.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle
It's simple and pure.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle
Pharo is fantastic for developers
who want to program practical things.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle
For teaching objects, it's tops!
