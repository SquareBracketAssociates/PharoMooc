-Hi.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,680
In this video, we are going
to look at the System Browser,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,240
which is a tool that helps you write
and navigate inside code,

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,680
packages, classes.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,600
In order to find it, you simply have
to go to your Pharo environment,

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,000
left-click and go to Tools,
then System Browser.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,640
Just click on that.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,840
This window will pop up
with four columns.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,280
The column on the left consists

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,920
of all the packages
that are present in your Pharo image.

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,600
You can see
that there are quite a lot of them.

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,360
If you want to go
inside one of these packages,

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
you simply have to click on it.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,160
For example, let's go inside AST-Core.

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,240
Click on it.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,520
You can see
that this column is now filled

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,000
and you can see
that those are all the classes

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,840
that are inside this package.

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,200
Now, if we want to go inside a class,
simply click on it

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,240
and you will see that the next
two columns will fill in as well.

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,560
The column on the right
consists of all the methods

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,400
that are in the RBComment class.

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,720
This one consists of protocols.

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,280
Protocols are tags
or groups of methods.

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,360
For example, right here, when we click,

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,560
we will have all the methods of the class

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,240
but if you want to filter
those methods a bit,

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,000
for example display only the ones
that belong to the printing protocol,

31
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,360
you can click on "printing" and see
that only printOn is filtered out.

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,920
Now, if we want to look
inside the body of a method,

33
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,520
we can click on it and you will see
that its body will appear here.

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,640
You can really investigate the packages,
classes and methods with this tool.

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,960
Now, another thing to note

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,680
is that you can look
at the class definition here

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,840
and the comments of the class
right there.

38
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,920
This is a small introduction
to the System Browser tool.

39
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,400
We will look into it a bit more
in the next videos.
