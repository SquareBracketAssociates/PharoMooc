00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,640
-Hi. In this video, we are going to have
a look at the Inspector tool from Pharo

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,160
and how it can help you
inspect your objects from within

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,920
and have a real close look

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,760
at how they work
and how you can interact with them.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,200
In order to use it,

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,400
I put up an expression that you certainly
will not see in real life.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,960
Basically, it is an "OrderedDictionary"
with three key values.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,120
Under the key "Time",
I put the "Time now",

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,520
under the "Date", the "Date today",

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,880
and under a "Morph" key,
I put an "HSVAColorSelectorMorph".

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,920
We will see what it looks like later on.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,960
If I want to open the Inspector
on this particular object,

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,120
I can right-click and go to "Inspect it"

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,760
or simply press the shortcut Cmd+I.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,360
So, let's click on it.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,760
We can see
that the Inspector is now open.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,200
I will just tidy the Playground.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,720
Now the Items tab is really interesting
but we will go over the Row tab first.

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,240
The Row tab shows you the actual
limitation of the "OrderedDictionary".

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,440
For example,

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,480
we have got the self representation

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,200
being the OrderedDictionary
with the three pairs of key values,

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,720
"Time", "time now", "Date", "date today",

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,760
and a certain Morph
that we will see later.

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,440
We have got the dictionary
and the ordered keys.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,960
If I click on the dictionary,

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,280
we will see that there is another tab
that will open on the right.

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,000
The nice thing that we can see there
is that we can, for example,

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,800
click another time
on the Array this time.

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,320
And we can see
that we now have three windows

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,760
and we can have a preview
of the first one below the window.

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,320
I can extend it.

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,440
I have got the three views
or I can restrict it to the last one.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,760
Right now, I am in the last one

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,120
and a nice thing is that I can interact
with this Array object

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,600
by for example writing "self at: 1"

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,160
and I can print this

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,880
and it will say that 1 has "Morph"

39
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
associated
with the "HSVAColorSelectorMorph".

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,480
If I want to go back to the other,
I can simply drag this back,

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,320
put it there or I can close it here

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,520
to have our two previous views.

43
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,000
Now, let's close this one,

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,520
we will have a closer look
to the Items tab

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,480
which is not represented in everything.

46
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,440
For example, if I go there
and I go to the 1 time,

47
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,320
you can see
that we have a different representation.

48
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,120
A nice thing that we can look at is...

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,400
Under String,

50
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,160
the items will be the number of
the different characters with the index.

51
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Here, for the Array, we will have
the index and the different items

52
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,880
and if I go to the items
for the OrderedDictionary

53
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,080
and close those too,

54
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,880
you can see that we have
three different pairs of key values,

55
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,720
for "Time", we have the "time now",
"Date" with "date now",

56
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,200
"Morph" with a certain Morph.

57
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,320
If I click on the "Time" thing,

58
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,760
you can see that we now have
a panel open with the time.

59
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,520
We can go over to Details,

60
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,680
I can show you
the different keys and things

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,040
that are present for the "Time" object.

62
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,320
We can also go there
and write "self browse"

63
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,160
and press Cmd+D to do it.

64
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,880
This will open the System Browser
on the actual Kernel package

65
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,680
and the Chronology tab.

66
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,360
And we can have a deeper look
inside the actual Time class.

67
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,880
Another thing you can do
right from within the Inspector

68
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,840
is to go over to the Meta tab.

69
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,480
There, you can access
the different methods of "Time"

70
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,560
and its class hierarchy.

71
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,800
So, we can go inside Magnitude,
Object or even ProtoObject.

72
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,880
You can filter everything.

73
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,200
For example,
if I want to look at duration,

74
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,560
I can see
that it will filter everything else out.

75
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,720
We can filter the different classes
if you have a complex hierarchy

76
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
and now, if we go to "Date",

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,880
you can see that this time,
I have got another tab called Calendar.

78
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,280
We do not have the tab items anymore

79
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,560
but we have got a calendar tab

80
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,240
that is a special tab made
for this subject

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,800
that will show us
that we are May 10th, 2020

82
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,040
and that it is located here
on the calendar.

83
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,920
Now, a nice thing we can see

84
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,160
is that if we go over
to the "Morph" object,

85
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,680
it is a really complex object

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,360
because we have several bounds.

87
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,840
We do not really know
how any of this works,

88
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,440
but we can open it in world.
"OpeninWorld".

89
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,560
Let's do that.

90
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,760
We can have a small look at it.

91
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,480
We have got a color selector,

92
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,760
then we have got
some kind of selector as well here

93
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,440
and a transparency selector there.

94
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,960
We can see that we can inspect
this object from here

95
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,040
by using "SelectedColor".

96
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,160
Now, if we would like to plug this color
in the Inspector,

97
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,600
we can right-click

98
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,080
and instead of doing
"Do it" or "Print it",

99
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,040
we can press "Do it and go" or Cmd+G.

100
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,960
This will plug the results
in the Inspector if I click there.

101
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,000
We can now see that we have got
this color right there.

102
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,360
That is really powerful.

103
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,360
Another thing you can do
is open the object twice.

104
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,200
If I go there, I will click on "self".

105
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,520
I will remove the first tab.

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,640
What we can do,
instead of exploring this complex object,

107
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,840
is go to Submorphs.

108
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,760
And on this, I go to Morph.

109
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,400
This is the "HSVAColorSelectorMorph"
all together.

110
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,120
Now, we can explore the tree composition

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,840
and if I click on, for example,
the "HColorSelectorMorph",

112
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,840
it will show me exactly what it is

113
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,560
and I can inspect it,

114
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,240
inspect the raw code
of this particular piece of Morph.

115
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,440
I can do the same thing there

116
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,640
and you can see that it will add
the different components

117
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
or show me exactly
what I am looking for.

118
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,640
The Inspector is a really nice way
to have a close look at your objects

119
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,120
and interact with them
from within them.

120
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,680
You can even interact
with the actual hierarchy,

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,320
browse for classes.

122
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,240
A nice thing you can do is implement
new tabs for your objects,

123
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,920
such as for example the Submorphs tab
or the Morph tab,

124
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,720
we had the Calendar tab for the date,

125
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,560
or the items for the different iterables.

126
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,880
So, the Inspector is a really nice way
to understand how the objects work.
