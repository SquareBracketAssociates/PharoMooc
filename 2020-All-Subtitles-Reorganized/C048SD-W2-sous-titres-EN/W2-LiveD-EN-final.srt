-Hi. In this video,
we are going to look at the packages

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,560
and how you can handle them
in the System Browser.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,600
If you remember correctly,

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,240
the System Browser can be accessed
via your environment,

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,760
go into Tools, then System Browser.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,880
All the packages are there on the left

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,960
and you can see that some of them
have triangles on their left side.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,520
This basically will show you

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,400
all the different tags
that have been used on this package.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,280
What does that mean?
Basically, if you click on the package,

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,720
you will see all the classes
from within it

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,840
and if you click on one of the tags,
for example Parser,

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,680
you can see that those classes
have been defined

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,040
using AST-Core-Parser.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,920
This means that you can really
structure your package as you want

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,520
and this will help you navigate inside it

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,520
and this will give out the structure
more clearly

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,520
for your readers, proofreaders
or any other developer working on it.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,800
Once again, you can simply do it
by using the name of the package,

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,160
"dash" the name of your tag.

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,440
Another important thing

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,840
that you can filter out
from the different packages

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,360
is by using collections.

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,480
For example,

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,880
this will show you all the packages
having collections in their name.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,400
And another thing you can do
is set up a scope

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,320
so you have the scoped view here.

30
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,640
If I click for example on AST-Core,
click on Scoped View,

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,160
I will only have this one
that will show up.

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,400
And I can also right-click
and go to Set up scope.

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,200
This will help me create a scope
with only the packages I need,

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,360
for example the three AST ones.

35
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,560
OK.

36
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,160
This will make your System Browser
count only those three packages.

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,920
So, what this will do

38
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,240
is only show you those three,

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,920
but it will also restrict the actions
you have on them, only on those three.

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,200
This will control the actions
you have on your environment

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,920
and restricts them
to only these three packages.

42
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,560
We saw how we can tag,

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,440
create tags inside packages

44
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,200
and set up a view
in the System Browser.
