00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.160 align:middle
hello, I’d like to show you
how to use 

00:00:04.327 --> 00:00:05.690 align:middle
the Finder to find information.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.010 align:middle
The Finder is a tool you will 
find in

00:00:08.177 --> 00:00:09.550 align:middle
the Tools menu, here Finder.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.470 align:middle
Let’s imagine I want to look for
a method

00:00:14.637 --> 00:00:16.750 align:middle
called match.
I write its name, match.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.160 align:middle
Here I choose Selectors.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.060 align:middle
Now I see all methods
containing

00:00:23.227 --> 00:00:28.000 align:middle
the word match, with the code 
here.

00:00:28.157 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle
As I set up big fonts,
we wil

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle
resize a little bit.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle
You see that when there is a
little

00:00:36.627 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle
triangle, it means the method

00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:41.930 align:middle
is defined over several classes, 
and I can read that kind of thing.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle
So that was for methods, and 
there is quite a lot.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle
You can look for things 
but that’s not ideal.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.000 align:middle
Now we can search for

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle
classes containing match,
here we see all our classes.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle
The best way is to unbrowse
using the code browser.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.880 align:middle
Now there a far better way.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle
Often we know what we are 
looking for

00:01:07.407 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle
but we don’t know how to express
it.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.390 align:middle
So here, I know that I’d
like to know if there

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:16.520 align:middle
is a method matching ab,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.380 align:middle
abcd, for instance, I write
ab*abcd

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle
and if something matches it returns
true.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle
And I choose Examples,
and I get all

00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle
the methods returning True.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle
I’m going to explain what we
see.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle
Here I see that superior 
works as well.

00:01:36.957 --> 00:01:38.380 align:middle
Ah, match seems interesting.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle
The system shows me all

00:01:42.677 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle
the classes defining
the match method, but 

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle
in particular the one with the
little star is the one

00:01:47.797 --> 00:01:49.200 align:middle
which method has returned true.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle
So now, we can try other examples.

00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle
For example, given 11, 2

00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle
what methods returns 5. Here
I will have

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle
// and I see what has

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle
returned true, it’s defined
on Integer, so it is

00:02:09.097 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle
this method or on aNumber
which is this method there.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle
So I do the same, in the same way:

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.100 align:middle
Now I want 5.5.
Then I only get Diviser.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle
So it’s very useful.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle
There another way to do it:

00:02:23.517 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle
you can look for 

00:02:27.077 --> 00:02:30.040 align:middle
all the Pragmas, Pragmas
are the annotations

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.210 align:middle
in the system. So if I 
look what is an 

00:02:33.377 --> 00:02:34.920 align:middle
annotation, for instance it is
this.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle
Here it is, I have annotated
my method with a pragma named

00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle
Menu, and the system can
make queries on it 

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle
to build menus.
Here by typing Menu, and

00:02:44.947 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle
selecting Pragma,
I can access to all the system’s

00:02:50.057 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle
pragmas containing the menu
word.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.320 align:middle
So here, we see that there are 2
for instance, 2 pragmas.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.400 align:middle
The worldMenu, the one which is
displayed 

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle
when you are here, is defined
by the Pragma menu.

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle
You see worldMenu.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle
The screenShotCommand
for example. HelpOn.

00:03:17.137 --> 00:03:19.520 align:middle
You see all these menus.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle
So know, with the Finder we 
can also

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle
look for methods

00:03:28.657 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle
containing the “Menu” string,
wherever they are.

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle
I’m gonna do it: it takes a little time.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle
What happens is that the system
scans

00:03:39.817 --> 00:03:41.230 align:middle
really all the body of all
the methods, there are

00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:45.320 align:middle
80 000 in Pharo, or a little 
bit more, and it displays the result.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.500 align:middle
So here, it’s really a textual
search.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle
What’s interesting sometimes,
when you see

00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:54.600 align:middle
a menu or something graphical
you can find it back. 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle
So here, you have all the 
methods containing the

00:03:59.067 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle
Menu word, in their names
as well as

00:04:03.467 --> 00:04:07.080 align:middle
elsewhere, here or there.
