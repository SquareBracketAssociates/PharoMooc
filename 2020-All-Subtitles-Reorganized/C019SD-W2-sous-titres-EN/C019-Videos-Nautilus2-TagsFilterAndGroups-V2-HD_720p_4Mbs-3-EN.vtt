In this video I’d
like to show you 2 or 3 tips

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.930 align:middle
for Nautilus.
So let’s start by opening it.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.340 align:middle
The first thing is that you see
packages

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.950 align:middle
with triangles and packages
without triangles.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.330 align:middle
if I click on the triangle,
we see that

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.560 align:middle
inside there are names.
What does that mean?

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.900 align:middle
If I click on AST-Core,
I can see all the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.810 align:middle
 classes containing this
package, as well as

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle
extensions, as I told you before
and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle
then I see names.
In fact I have what we

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle
call tags, these are not packages,
these are not

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle
sub-packages, these are only
logical groups of classes.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.670 align:middle
For a certain reason, the developer
has chosen that, to browse 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle
his package, it would be easier 
to represent classes,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle
first with all classes, 
and second

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle
with the organisation that 
suits him.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle
For instance, here there is
Formatter, there are 2 code

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.910 align:middle
Formatter for Pharo. Here on Nodes
there are all the nodes

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle
of the abstract syntax tree.
Here there is the Parser, and there

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.310 align:middle
Tokens for example, and Visitors.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle
You can see that very quickly,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.580 align:middle
when you want to do something,
you can go directly on the right category.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.130 align:middle
So here now,
I would like to show you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.890 align:middle
how you can filter 
the information 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.240 align:middle
Nautilus gives you and how 
you can create groups to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle
manage your development.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle
Let’s open Nautilus.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle
If I type for instance Collections,

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle
I will get collections,
I will get all the packages

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle
which have the word Collections 
either in their name or in their tag.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle
If we look here, there is this.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle
So this is very helpful.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle
You can also associate them,
there I can have all

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle
packages containing 
Morph and Collections.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.210 align:middle
There is also another way to do
it, let’s imagine

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.130 align:middle
we work on Fuel. Fuel is Pharo’s
Serializer.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle
I take all the Fuel packages and
I put them in another group.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.440 align:middle
So here I put it in a Work
group, it means

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.050 align:middle
that next time I will open 
Nautilus, I will 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle
have a group named Work.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle
In this Work group I have
all my Fuel packages that will

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.920 align:middle
offer me exactly the same
functionalities than before.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle
So it is quite practical,
I don’t have to write a 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle
search each time, 
I know I have this. 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle
In the same way, if you click 
on Work and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.210 align:middle
you create a new group,
you can call it

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle
MyNewGroup, and for instance
if you want to add

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle
Core inside, you do
"Add in group" “MyNewGroup” and

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle
you will have your package inside.
