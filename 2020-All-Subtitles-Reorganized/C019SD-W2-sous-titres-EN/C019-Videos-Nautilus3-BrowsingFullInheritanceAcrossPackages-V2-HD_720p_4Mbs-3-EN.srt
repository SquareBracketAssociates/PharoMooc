00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,550
In this video, I’d like to show 
you a tip with Nautilus.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,370
And just for you to know: 
Nautilus is the submarine name

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,500
in Jules Verne’s “20 000 
Leagues Under the Sea” 

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,420
Nautilus enables to navigate
under the seas so it suits

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,490
very very well to Pharo.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,430
Let’s have a look to the
OrderedCollection class.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,070
It is defined in the
Collection-Sequenceable package.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,500
In this package, there are several
core classes of the system.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,400
There is the Array class, 
the Interval class, LinkedList class.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,070
I can see that in the package
there is

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,840
the OrderedCollection class which
has a sub-class, SortedCollection.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,280
Now what I can also see,

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,390
which is not expressed in
a graphical way,

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,800
it is that OrderedCollection is
a sub-class of SequenceableCollection.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,820
Sometimes, I would like to

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,390
navigate inside the super-class
in order to see which

17
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,410
methods are redefined or 
this kind of thing.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,510
To do this, I click on
Inheritance.

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,120
Hence, I see the hierarchy, 
I see the super-class

20
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,430
of OrderedCollection,
SequenceableCollection and its hierarchy.

21
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,550
I also see that there are other sub-classes
of OrderedCollection

22
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,950
in other packages,
and I see that

23
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,210
SortedCollection is a sub-class
of OrderedCollection,

24
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,660
this is in black, I am 
still in the package 

25
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,210
containing OrderedCollection.

26
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,090
So, like this, I can browse, 
and see

27
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,850
the methods which are 
in other packages.

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,230
Now, if I unselect
this mode while I’m on

29
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,890
the super-class,
what will I see?

30
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,330
I will see the class package.

31
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,450
So, the SequenceableCollection
class is in the

32
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,440
Collection-Abstract package.

33
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,180
So now if I ask again to see the
inheritance,

34
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,490
I will see all the 
sub-classes and super-classes 

35
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,480
inheritance of
SequenceableCollection.

36
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,990
I see that
SequenceableCollection inherits from

37
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,640
Collection in the same package, 
that it defines in the same

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,260
package ArrayedCollection.
I see that the hierarchy is

39
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,490
is quite big, so normally
I should find

40
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,620
somewhere
OrderedCollection, and OrderedCollection is here.

41
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,190
Now if I select again
OrderedCollection and I

42
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,700
click again on Inheritance,
I will go back into

43
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,390
the original package, Sequenceable.

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,440
And we are back to the start.

45
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,670
What you’ve seen there is 
that Nautilus will

46
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,260
enable you to browse
the inheritance ignoring

47
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,130
packages, while showing
in which package you are browsing.
